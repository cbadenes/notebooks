Multiorgan MRI can provide further insight on the repercussions of COVID-19 on organ health but requires a balance between richness and quality of data acquisition and total scan duration. We adapted the UK Biobank brain MRI protocol to produce high-quality images while being suitable as part of a post-COVID-19 multiorgan MRI exam. The analysis pipeline, also adapted from UK Biobank, includes new imaging-derived phenotypes (IDPs) designed to assess the effects of COVID-19. A first application of the protocol and pipeline was performed in 51 COVID-19 patients post-hospital discharge and 25 controls participating in the Oxford C-MORE study. The protocol acquires high resolution T1, T2-FLAIR, diffusion weighted images, susceptibility weighted images, and arterial spin labelling data in 17 minutes.

In the C-MORE data, these quantitative measures were consistent with clinical radiology reports.

These differences were generally more prominent in patients who received organ support. Increased T2* in the thalamus was also observed in recovered COVID-19 patients, with a more prominent increase for non-critical patients.

Multiorgan MRI can provide further insight on the repercussions of COVID-19 on organ health but requires a balance between richness and quality of data acquisition and total scan duration. We adapted the UK Biobank brain MRI protocol to produce high-quality images while being suitable as part of a post-COVID-19 multiorgan MRI exam. The analysis pipeline, also adapted from UK Biobank, includes new imaging-derived phenotypes (IDPs) designed to assess the effects of COVID-19. A first application of the protocol and pipeline was performed in 51 COVID-19 patients post-hospital discharge and 25 controls participating in the Oxford C-MORE study. The protocol acquires high resolution T1, T2-FLAIR, diffusion weighted images, susceptibility weighted images, and arterial spin labelling data in 17 minutes.

We performed a prospective diagnostic study. Consecutive inclusion of patients coming for COVID-PCR testing to 19 general practices. Contact history and self-reported symptoms served as index test. PCR testing of nasopharyngeal swabs served as reference standard. Complete data were available from 1141 patients, 605 (53.0%) female, average age 42.2 years, 182 (16.0%) COVID-PCR positive. Multivariable logistic regression showed highest odds ratios (ORs) for \\\"contact with infected person\\\" (OR 9.22, 95% CI 5.61-15.41), anosmia/ageusia (8.79, 4.89-15.95), fever (4.25, 2.56-7.09), and \\\"sudden disease onset\\\" (2.52, 1.55-4.14). Patients with \\\"contact with infected person\\\" or \\\"anosmia/ageusia\\\" with or without self-reported \\\"fever\\\" had a high probability of COVID infection up to 84.8%. Negative response to the four items \\\"contact with infected person, anosmia/ageusia, fever, sudden disease onset\\\" showed a negative predictive value (NPV) of 0.98 (95% CI 0.96-0.99).

In a previous study, we established an hDPP4-transgenic (hDPP4-Tg) mouse model in which MERS-CoV infection causes severe acute respiratory failure and high mortality accompanied by an elevated secretion of cytokines and chemokines. Since excessive complement activation is an important factor that contributes to acute lung injury after viral infection, in this study, we investigated the role of complement in MERS-CoV-induced lung damage. Our study showed that complement was excessively activated in MERS-CoV-infected hDPP4-Tg mice through observations of increased concentrations of the C5a and C5b-9 complement activation products in sera and lung tissues, respectively. Interestingly, blocking C5a production by targeting its receptor, C5aR, alleviated lung and spleen tissue damage and reduced inflammatory responses. More importantly, anti-C5aR antibody treatment led to decreased viral replication in lung tissues. Furthermore, compared with the sham treatment control, apoptosis of splenic cells was less pronounced in the splenic white pulp of treated mice, and greater number of proliferating splenic cells, particularly in the red pulp, was observed. These data indicate that (1) dysregulated host immune responses contribute to the severe outcome of MERS; (2) excessive complement activation, triggered by MERS-CoV infection, promote such dysregulation; and (3) blockade of the C5a-C5aR axis lead to the decreased tissue damage induced by MERS-CoV infection, as manifested by reduced apoptosis and T cell regeneration in the spleen. Therefore, the results of this study suggest a new strategy for clinical intervention and adjunctive treatment in MERS-CoV cases. \",\n\"Blockade of the C5a-C5aR axis alleviates lung damage in hDPP4-transgenic mice infected with MERS-CoV[SEP]The pathogenesis of highly pathogenic Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) remains poorly understood.

The Commentary by Parvez [1] briefly reviews the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in fecal samples, including its persistence, and the finding of gastrointestinal complaints in a minority of hospitalized patients. Others have also highlighted that some COVID-19 patients present primarily or exclusively with gastrointestinal manifestations.

Of course, fecal aerosols were implicated in a very large SARS outbreaks in Hong Kong in 2003. However, infectious SARS-CoV-2 has been only rarely isolated from fecal samples to date, and the possible risks of fecal-oral or fecal-aerosol transmission remain to be clarified. Interestingly, Parvez points out the greater expression of ACE-2 receptor in cholangiocytes than hepatocytes in COVID-19 patients and speculates about how this and other mechanisms, particularly immune-mediated ones, might be contributing to the substantial frequency of hepatic abnormalities seen in hospitalized patients. Of course, other factors including hypoxemia, ischemia and medication side effects are also likely to be contributory. The latter concern has led to premature discontinuation of intravenous remdesivir therapy in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The immunopathologic effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-6 are the subject of ongoing randomized, controlled trials in severe COVID-19. The thoughtful Commentary article by Conway et al.

Like many other inner city populations, the one in Vancouver has high frequencies of psychiatric disorders, opiate drug dependence and overdose-related deaths.

We demonstrate that hyperlipidemic animals succumbed to a non-lethal dose of LPS whereas normolipidemic controls survived. Strikingly, survival of hyperlipidemic animals was restored when the nuclear import of stress-responsive transcription factors (SRTFs), Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Proteins (SREBPs), and Carbohydrate-Responsive Element-Binding Proteins (ChREBPs) was impeded by targeting the nuclear transport checkpoint with cell-penetrating, biselective nuclear transport modifier (NTM) peptide. Furthermore, the burst of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, microvascular endothelial injury in the liver, lungs, heart, and kidneys, and trafficking of inflammatory cells were also suppressed. To dissect the role of nuclear transport signaling pathways we designed and developed importin-selective NTM peptides. Selective targeting of the importin \\u03b15, ferrying SRTFs and ChREBPs, protected 70-100% hyperlipidemic animals. Targeting importin \\u03b21, that transports SREBPs, was only effective after 3-week treatment that lowered blood triglycerides, cholesterol, glucose, and averted fatty liver. Thus, the mechanism of hyperlipidemic hypersensitivity to lethal microbial inflammation depends on metabolic and proinflammatory transcription factors mobilization, which can be counteracted by targeting the nuclear transport checkpoint. \",\n\"Hyperlipidemic hypersensitivity to lethal microbial inflammation and its reversal by selective targeting of nuclear transport shuttles Hyperlipidemia, the hallmark of Metabolic Syndrome that afflicts millions of people worldwide, exacerbates life-threatening infections[SEP]We present a new evidence for the mechanism of hyperlipidemic hypersensitivity to microbial inflammation caused by pathogen-derived inducer, LPS.

Non-invasive ventilation (NIV) is the standard therapy for hypercapnic acidotic respiratory failure in AECOPD. Despite its beneficial effects, NIV is often poorly tolerated (11-34 % failure rate). An increasing number of studies have documented a beneficial effect of nasal high-flow (NHF) in acute hypercapnia. We designed a prospective, randomized, multicentre, open label, non-inferiority trial to compare treatment failure in nasal NHF vs NIV in patients with acidotic hypercapnic AECOPD. The study will be conducted in about 35 sites in Germany. Patients with hypercapnic AECOPD with respiratory acidosis (pH < 7.35) will be randomized 1:1 to NIV or NHF. The primary outcome is the combined endpoint of intubation, treatment failure or death at 72 h. The switch from one to the other device marks a device failure but acts as a rescue treatment in absence of intubation criteria. A sample size of 720 was calculated to have 80% power for showing that NHF is non-inferior to NIV with a margin of 8 percentage points.

To shed light on these mechanisms, we adapted a \\\"think aloud\\\" paradigm to quantify the content and dynamics of individuals' thoughts at rest. Across two studies, external raters hand coded the content of each thought and computed dynamic metrics spanning duration, transition probabilities between affective states, and conceptual similarity over time. Study 1 highlighted the paradigm's high ecological validity and revealed a narrowing of conceptual scope following more negative content. Study 2 replicated Study 1's findings and examined individual difference predictors of trait brooding, a maladaptive form of rumination. Across individuals, increased trait brooding was linked to thoughts rated as more negative, past-oriented and selffocused. Longer negative and shorter positive thoughts were also apparent as brooding increased, as well as a tendency to shift away from positive conceptual states, and a stronger narrowing of conceptual scope following negative thoughts. Importantly, content and dynamics explained independent variance, accounting for a third of the variance in brooding. These results uncover a realtime cognitive signature of rumination and highlight the predictive and ecological validity of the think aloud paradigm applied to resting state cognition. Contemplated upon by early Buddhists and later by William James, the stream of thought, or consciousness, is an obscure but ubiquitous aspect of our waking life 1 .

WGS analyses showed that the HAdV-7 isolates from the two outbreaks were genetically indistinguishable; however, a 12 bp deletion in the virus-associated RNA gene distinguished the outbreak isolates from other HAdV-7 isolates. Outbreak HAdV-7 isolates demonstrated increased viral replication compared to non-outbreak associated HAdV-7 isolate. Epidemiological data supported that the first outbreak was caused by introduction of the novel HAdV-7 virus by an infected recruit upon arrival at the training base. Nosocomial transmission by close contacts was the most likely source leading to onset of the second HAdV-7 outbreak, establishing the apparent transmission link between the outbreaks.

We aimed to examine how laboratory errors may arise from factors, e.g., flexible working order, staff displacement, changes in the number of tests, and samples will reflect on the total test process (TTP) during the pandemic period. Materials and methods: In 12 months, 6 months before and during the pandemic, laboratory errors were assessed via quality indicators (QIs) related to TTP phases. QIs were grouped as pre-, intra-and postanalytical. The results of QIs were expressed in defect percentages and sigma, evaluated with 3 levels of performance quality: 25 th , 50 th and 75 th percentile values. Results: When the pre-and during pandemic periods were compared, the sigma value of the samples not received was significantly lower in prepandemic group than during pandemic group (4.7\\u03c3 vs. 5.4\\u03c3, P = 0.003). The sigma values of samples transported inappropriately and haemolysed samples were significantly higher in pre-pandemic period than during pandemic (5.0\\u03c3 vs. 4.9\\u03c3, 4.3\\u03c3 vs. 4.1\\u03c3; P = 0.046 and P = 0.044, respectively). Sigma value of tests with inappropriate IQC performances was lower during pandemic compared to the pre-pandemic period (3.3\\u03c3 vs. 3.2\\u03c3, P = 0.081).

It was observed that preanalytical phase was affected more by the pandemic. \",\n\"The response of total testing process in clinical laboratory medicine to COVID-19 pandemic[SEP]Introduction: Following a pandemic, laboratory medicine is vulnerable to laboratory errors due to the stressful and high workloads. We aimed to examine how laboratory errors may arise from factors, e.g., flexible working order, staff displacement, changes in the number of tests, and samples will reflect on the total test process (TTP) during the pandemic period. Materials and methods: In 12 months, 6 months before and during the pandemic, laboratory errors were assessed via quality indicators (QIs) related to TTP phases. QIs were grouped as pre-, intra-and postanalytical. The results of QIs were expressed in defect percentages and sigma, evaluated with 3 levels of performance quality: 25 th , 50 th and 75 th percentile values. Results: When the pre-and during pandemic periods were compared, the sigma value of the samples not received was significantly lower in prepandemic group than during pandemic group (4.7\\u03c3 vs. 5.4\\u03c3, P = 0.003). The sigma values of samples transported inappropriately and haemolysed samples were significantly higher in pre-pandemic period than during pandemic (5.0\\u03c3 vs. 4.9\\u03c3, 4.3\\u03c3 vs. 4.1\\u03c3; P = 0.046 and P = 0.044, respectively). Sigma value of tests with inappropriate IQC performances was lower during pandemic compared to the pre-pandemic period (3.3\\u03c3 vs. 3.2\\u03c3, P = 0.081). Sigma value of the reports delivered outside the specified time was higher during pandemic than pre-pandemic period (3.0\\u03c3 vs. 3.1\\u03c3, P = 0.030). Conclusion: In all TTP phases, some quality indicators improved while others regressed during the pandemic period. It was observed that preanalytical phase was affected more by the pandemic. \"],\n [\"Membrane topology of gp41 and amyloid precursor protein: Interfering transmembrane interactions as potential targets for HIV and Alzheimer treatment\",\n\"The amyloid precursor protein (APP), that plays a critical role in the development of senile plaques in Alzheimer disease (AD), and the gp41 envelope protein of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the causative agent of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), are single-spanning type-1 transmembrane (TM) glycoproteins with the ability to form homo-oligomers. In this review we describe similarities, both in structural terms and sequence determinants of their TM and juxtamembrane regions. The TM domains are essential not only for anchoring the proteins in membranes but also have functional roles. Both TM segments contain GxxxG motifs that drive TM associations within the lipid bilayer. They also each possess similar sequence motifs, positioned at the membrane interface preceding their TM domains. These domains are known as cholesterol recognition/interaction amino acid consensus (CRAC) motif in gp41 and CRAC-like motif in APP. Moreover, in the cytoplasmic domain of both proteins other \\u03b1-helical membranotropic regions with functional implications have been identified. Recent drug developments targeting both diseases are reviewed and the potential use of TM interaction modulators as therapeutic targets is discussed. \",\n\"Membrane topology of gp41 and amyloid precursor protein: Interfering transmembrane interactions as potential targets for HIV and Alzheimer treatment[SEP]The amyloid precursor protein (APP), that plays a critical role in the development of senile plaques in Alzheimer disease (AD), and the gp41 envelope protein of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the causative agent of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), are single-spanning type-1 transmembrane (TM) glycoproteins with the ability to form homo-oligomers.

The objective of the present study was to determine the causes and epidemiology of morbidity and mortality in dairy, beef and crossbred white veal production. A total of 5853 calves, housed in 15 production cohorts, were followed during one production cycle. Causes of mortality were determined by necropsy. Morbidity was daily recorded by the producers. Results: The total mortality risk was 5,3% and was significantly higher in beef veal production compared to dairy or crossbreds. The main causes of mortality were pneumonia (1.3% of the calves at risk), ruminal disorders (0.7%), idiopathic peritonitis (0.5%), enterotoxaemia (0.5%) and enteritis (0.4%). Belgian Blue beef calves were more likely to die from pneumonia, enterotoxaemia and arthritis. Detection of bovine viral diarrhea virus at necropsy was associated with chronic pneumonia and pleuritis. Of the calves, 25.4% was treated individually and the morbidity rate was 1.66 cases per 1000 calf days at risk. The incidence rate of respiratory disease, diarrhea, arthritis and otitis was 0.95, 0.30, 0.11 and 0.07 cases per 1000 calf days at risk respectively. Morbidity peaked in the first three weeks after arrival and gradually declined towards the end of the production cycle. Conclusions: The present study provided insights into the causes and epidemiology of morbidity and mortality in white veal calves in Belgium, housed in the most frequent housing system in Europe. The necropsy findings, identified risk periods and differences between production systems can guide both veterinarians and producers towards the most profitable and ethical preventive and therapeutic protocols. \",\n\"Longitudinal study on morbidity and mortality in white veal calves in Belgium Longitudinal study on morbidity and mortality in white veal calves in Belgium[SEP]Background: Mortality and morbidity are hardly documented in the white veal industry, despite high levels of antimicrobial drug use and resistance.

Production and Hosting by Elsevier on behalf of KeAi ScienceDirect\",\n\"Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the etiology and prevalence of pediatric CAP in Beijing using a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. Methods: Between February 15, 2011 and January 18, 2012, 371 pediatric patients with CAP were enrolled at Beijing Children's Hospital. Sixteen respiratory viruses and two bacteria were detected from tracheal aspirate specimens using commercially available multiplex real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) kits. Results: A single viral pathogen was detected in 35.3% of enrolled patients, multiple viruses in 11.6%, and virus/bacteria coinfection in 17.8%. In contrast, only 6.5% of patients had a single bacterial pathogen and 2.2% were infected with multiple bacteria. The etiological agent was unknown for 26.7% of patients. The most common viruses were respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (43.9%), rhinovirus (14.8%), parainfluenza virus (9.4%), and adenovirus (8.6%). In patients under three years of age, RSV (44.6%), rhinovirus (12.8%), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (9.9%) were the most frequent pathogens. In children aged 3e7 years, S. pneumoniae (38.9%), RSV (30.6%), Haemophilus influenzae (19.4%), and adenovirus (19.4%) were most prevalent. Finally in children over seven years, RSV (47.3%), S. pneumoniae (41.9%), and rhinovirus (21.5%) infections were most frequent. Conclusions: Viral pathogens, specifically RSV, were responsible for the majority of CAP in pediatric patients. However, both S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae contributed as major causes of disease.

The relatively small, 123 amino acid, N protein of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), an arterivirus, presents an ideal model system for investigating the properties and mechanism of N protein nucleolar localization. The PRRSV N protein is found in both cytoplasmic and nucleolar compartments during infection and after transfection of gene constructs that express N-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) fusion proteins. Experiments using oligopeptides, truncated polypeptides and amino acid-substituted proteins have identified several domains within PRRSV N protein that participate in nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling, including a cryptic nuclear localization signal (NLS) called NLS-1, a functional NLS (NLS-2), a nucleolar localization sequence (NoLS), as well as a possible nuclear export signal (NES).

The present study aimed to identify the active chemical constituents of this traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and investigate their mechanisms through interleukin-6 (IL-6) integrating network pharmacological approaches. Methods: We collected the compounds from all herbal ingredients of the previously mentioned TCM, but those that could down-regulate IL-6 were screened through the network pharmacology approach. Then, we modeled molecular docking to evaluate the binding affinity between compounds and IL-6. Furthermore, we analyzed the biological processes and pathways of compounds. Finally, we screened out the core genes of compounds through the construction of the protein-protein interaction network and the excavation of gene clusters of compounds. Results: The network pharmacology research showed that TCM could decrease IL-6 using several compounds, such as quercetin, ursolic acid, luteolin, and rutin. Molecular docking results showed that the molecular binding affinity with IL-6 of all compounds except \\u03b3-aminobutyric acid was < \\u22125.0 kJ/mol, indicating the potential of numerous active compounds in TCM to directly interact with IL-6, leading to an anti-inflammation effect. Finally, Cytoscape 3.7.2 was used to topologize the biological processes and pathways of compounds, revealing potential mechanisms for COVID-19 treatment.

Methods: Individual information on confirmed cases from January 21 to March 2 was collected from provincial or municipal health commissions. We identified the difference between imported and local cases in the epidemiological characteristics. Two models were established to estimate the factors associated with time interval from symptom onset to hospitalization (TOH) and length of hospital stay (LOS) respectively. Results: Among 7,042 cases, 3392 (48.17%) were local cases and 3304 (46.92%) were imported cases. Since the first intervention was adopted in Hubei on January 23, the daily reported imported cases reached a peak on January 28 and gradually decreased since then. Imported cases were on average younger (41 vs. 48), and had more male (58.66% vs. 47.53%) compared to local cases. Furthermore, imported cases had more contacts with other confirmed cases (2.80\\u00b12.33 vs. 2.17\\u00b12.10), which were mainly within family members (2.26\\u00b12.18 vs. 1.57\\u00b12.06).

The aim of this study is to give insight into safety risks in grain handling facilities through information processing of workers' compensation data on agro-manufacturing occupational incidents within commercial grain elevators in the Midwest region of the United States between 2008 and 2016. The severity of occupational incidents is determined by total dollar amount incurred on medical, indemnity, and other expenses in workers' compensation claims. The most important factors that affect the cost escalation of occupational incidents are extracted using bootstrap partitioning method, and are applied as input for constructing two machine learning models: random forests decision trees, and na\\u00efve Bayes. Both models show high accuracy (87.64% and 92.78% respectively) in predicting that a future claim is classified as either low or medium, severity. The models contribute to identifying high injury risk groups, and prevalent incident causes, allowing a more research-based focused intervention effort in grain handling workplaces.

The aim of this study is to give insight into safety risks in grain handling facilities through information processing of workers' compensation data on agro-manufacturing occupational incidents within commercial grain elevators in the Midwest region of the United States between 2008 and 2016. The severity of occupational incidents is determined by total dollar amount incurred on medical, indemnity, and other expenses in workers' compensation claims. The most important factors that affect the cost escalation of occupational incidents are extracted using bootstrap partitioning method, and are applied as input for constructing two machine learning models: random forests decision trees, and na\\u00efve Bayes. Both models show high accuracy (87.64% and 92.78% respectively) in predicting that a future claim is classified as either low or medium, severity.

RNA interference, a conserved mechanism in which a sequencespecific gene-silencing process is mediated by small interfering RNA (siRNA), is a promising method of gene therapy in treating a variety of viral diseases. Aim. To investigate the antiviral effects of siRNA on herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) replication in Vero cells. Methods. The antiviral effects of siRNA duplexes targeting the VP16 and DNA polymerase genes of HSV-1 were evaluated by yield-reduction and plaque-reduction assays. The effect of siRNA on the expression of target genes was measured by real-time quantitative reverse transcription PCR. Results. Two siRNA duplexes (siRNA-1, targeting VP16, and siRNA-4, targeting DNA polymerase), were found to be highly effective in inhibiting HSV-1 replication. siRNA-1 and siRNA-4 reduced HSV-1 replication by around 2 log 10 and 1 log 10 in the yield-reduction assay and by 85% and 70% in the plaque-reduction assay, respectively. Significant decreases in the mRNA level of VP16 and DNA polymerase genes were detected after viral infection in the Vero cells pretreated with siRNA-1 and siRNA-4, respectively. Conclusion. These results indicate that siRNA can potently inhibit HSV-1 replication in vitro, suggesting that siRNA-based antiviral therapy may be a potential effective therapeutic alternative for patients with HSV-1 infection. \",\n\"Inhibition of herpes simplex virus type 1 by small interfering RNA[SEP]Background.

These pathways are tightly regulated by the host to prevent an inappropriate cellular response, but viruses can modulate these pathways to proliferate and spread. In this study, we revealed a novel mechanism in which hepatitis C virus (HCV) evades the immune surveillance system to proliferate by activating microRNA-21 (miR-21). We demonstrated that HCV infection upregulates miR-21, which in turn suppresses HCV-triggered type I IFN production, thus promoting HCV replication. Furthermore, we demonstrated that miR-21 targets two important factors in the TLR signaling pathway, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88) and interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 1 (IRAK1), which are involved in HCV-induced type I IFN production. HCV-mediated activation of miR-21 expression requires viral proteins and several signaling components. Moreover, we identified a transcription factor, activating protein-1 (AP-1), which is partly responsible for miR-21 induction in response to HCV infection through PKCe/JNK/c-Jun and PKCa/ERK/c-Fos cascades. Taken together, our results indicate that miR-21 is upregulated during HCV infection and negatively regulates IFN-a signaling through MyD88 and IRAK1 and may be a potential therapeutic target for antiviral intervention. \",\n\"HCV-Induced miR-21 Contributes to Evasion of Host Immune System by Targeting MyD88 and IRAK1[SEP]Upon recognition of viral components by pattern recognition receptors, such as the toll-like receptors (TLRs) and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like helicases, cells are activated to produce type I interferon (IFN) and proinflammatory cytokines.

In addition to corticosteroids, and antiviral drugs like remdesivir, various immunotherapies including monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to S protein of SARS-CoV-2 have been investigated to treat COVID-19 patients. These mAbs were initially developed against the wild-type SARS-CoV-2; however, emergence of variant forms of SARS-CoV-2 having mutations in the spike protein in several countries including India raised serious questions on the potential use of these mAbs against SARS-CoV-2 variants. In this study, using an in silico approach, we have examined the binding abilities of eight mAbs against several SARS-CoV-2 variants of Alpha (B.1.1.7) and Delta (B.1.617.2) lineages. The structure of the Fab region of each mAb was designed in silico and subjected to molecular docking against each mutant protein. mAbs were subjected to two levels of selection based on their binding energy, stability, and conformational flexibility. Our data reveal that tixagevimab, regdanvimab, and cilgavimab can efficiently neutralize most of the SARS-CoV-2 Alpha strains while tixagevimab, bamlanivimab, and sotrovimab can form a stable complex with the Delta variants. Based on these data, we have designed, by in silico, a chimeric antibody by conjugating the CDRH3 of regdanivimab with a sotrovimab framework to combat the variants that could potentially escape from the mAbmediated neutralization. Our finding suggests that though currently available mAbs could be used to treat COVID-19 caused by the variants of SARS-CoV-2, better results could be expected with the chimeric antibodies. \",\n\"In Silico Analyses on the Comparative Potential of Therapeutic Human Monoclonal Antibodies Against Newly Emerged SARS-CoV-2 Variants Bearing Mutant Spike Protein[SEP]Since the start of the pandemic, SARS-CoV-2 has already infected more than 250 million people globally, with more than five million fatal cases and huge socio-economic losses.

People who were born preterm may be at greater risk for COVID-19 because their early 36 exposure to oxygen at birth increases their risk of being hospitalized when infected with RSV and 37 other respiratory viruses. Our prior studies in mice showed how high levels of oxygen (hyperoxia) 38 between postnatal days 0-4 increases the severity of influenza A virus infections by reducing the 39 number of alveolar epithelial type 2 (AT2) cells. Because AT2 cells express the SARS-CoV-2 40 receptors angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2) and transmembrane protease/serine subfamily 41 member 2 (TMPRSS2), we expected their expression would decline as AT2 cells were depleted by 42 hyperoxia. Instead, we made the surprising discovery that expression of Ace2 and Tmprss2 mRNA 43 increases as mice age and is accelerated by exposing mice to neonatal hyperoxia. ACE2 is primarily 44 expressed at birth by airway Club cells and becomes detectable in AT2 cells by one year of life. Neonatal hyperoxia increases ACE2 expression in Club cells and makes it detectable in 2-month-old 46 AT2 cells. This early and increased expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors was not seen in adult mice 47 who had been administered the mitochondrial superoxide scavenger mitoTEMPO during hyperoxia. Our finding that early life insults such as hyperoxia enhances the age-dependent expression of SARS- CoV-2 receptors in the respiratory epithelium helps explain why COVID-19 lung disease is greater in 50 the elderly and people with pre-existing co-morbidities. 51 52 53 54 \",\n\"Neonatal hyperoxia enhances age-dependent expression of SARS-CoV-2 receptors in mice 2 3[SEP]The severity of COVID-19 lung disease is higher in the elderly and people with pre-existing co-35 morbidities.

Fundamental to the design of rapid state responses is the ability to perform epidemiological model parameter inference for localised trajectory predictions. In this work, we perform Bayesian parameter inference using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods on the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) and Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) epidemiological models with time-varying spreading rates for South Africa. The results find two change points in the spreading rate of COVID-19 in South Africa as inferred from the confirmed cases. The first change point coincides with state enactment of a travel ban and the resultant containment of imported infections. The second change point coincides with the start of a state-led mass screening and testing programme which has highlighted community-level disease spread that was not well represented in the initial largely traveller based and private laboratory dominated testing data. The results further suggest that due to the likely effect of the national lockdown, community level transmissions are slower than the original imported case driven spread of the disease.

The second change point coincides with the start of a state-led mass screening and testing programme which has highlighted community-level disease spread that was not well represented in the initial largely traveller based and private laboratory dominated testing data. The results further suggest that due to the likely effect of the national lockdown, community level transmissions are slower than the original imported case driven spread of the disease.

Cancer registration is an instrumental component of any cancer control strategy, providing the data to inform effective cancer policy. In the Middle East, North Africa, and Turkey (MENAT) region, cancer registration varies immensely and faces multifaceted challenges including protracted conflict. This study investigates and maps out the present capacities and outputs of cancer registration in the MENAT region and identifies thematic barriers facing implementation and utilization of cancer registry data. We used a self-administered online survey with open and close-ended questions targeting national and institutional cancer registry managers in the MENAT countries. RESULTS Registry managers from 19 MENAT countries reported the presence of 97 population-based, 48 hospital-based, and 24 pathology-based registries. Most population-based registries were well-or partially developed. Lack of accurate death records, complete medical records, and communication between stakeholders and deficiencies in trained personnel were critical challenges that were more severe in active conflict zones and neighboring conflict-affected regions. Cancer registration challenges included weak health infrastructure, absence of legislation mandating cancer registration, and disruption of cancer registration because of active conflict and loss of funding. Refugee host countries, such as Lebanon, Turkey, and Jordan, also reported conflict-related challenges including refugee mobility and lack of accurate data on forced migrants. CONCLUSION This study provides a much-needed understanding of the current landscape and contextual challenges affecting cancer registration in the MENAT.

In this context, the use of infoveillance tools has become a primary necessity. Objective: The aim of this study is to test the reliability of a widely used infoveillance tool which is Google Trends. In particular, the paper focuses on the analysis of relative search volumes (RSVs) quantifying their dependence on the day they are collected. Methods: RSVs of the query coronavirus + covid during February 1-December 4, 2020 (period 1), and February 20-May 18, 2020 (period 2), were collected daily by Google Trends from December 8 to 27, 2020. The survey covered Italian regions and cities, and countries and cities worldwide. The search category was set to all categories. Each dataset was analyzed to observe any dependencies of RSVs from the day they were gathered. To do this, by calling i the country, region, or city under investigation and j the day its RSV was collected, a Gaussian distribution X i X(\\u03c3 i , x i ) was used to represent the trend of daily variations of x ij RSVs ij . When a missing value was revealed (anomaly), the affected country, region or city was excluded from the analysis. When the anomalies exceeded 20% of the sample size, the whole sample was excluded from the statistical analysis. Pearson and Spearman correlations between RSVs and the number of COVID-19 cases were calculated day by day thus to highlight any variations related to the day RSVs were collected. Welch's t-test was used to assess the statistical significance of the differences between the average RSVs of the various countries, regions, or cities of a given dataset. Two RSVs were considered statistical confident when t < 1.5. A dataset was deemed unreliable if the confident data exceeded 20% (confidence threshold). The percentage increase \\u0394 was used to quantify the difference between two values. Results: Google Trends has been subject to an acceptable quantity of anomalies only as regards the RSVs of Italian regions (0% in both periods 1 and 2) and countries worldwide (9.7% during period 1 and 10.9% during period 2). However, the correlations between RSVs and COVID-19 cases underwent significant variations even in these two datasets (Max |\\u0394| + 625% for Italian regions, and Max |\\u0394| +175% for countries worldwide). Furthermore, only RSVs of countries worldwide did not exceed confidence threshold. Finally, the large amount of anomalies registered in Italian and international cities' RSVs made these datasets unusable for any kind of statistical inference. Conclusion: In the considered timespans, Google Trends has proved to be reliable only for surveys concerning RSVs of countries worldwide. Since RSVs values showed a high dependence on the day they were gathered, it is essential for future research that the authors collect queries' data for several consecutive days and work with their RSVs averages instead of daily RSVs, trying to minimize the standard errors until an established confidence threshold is respected. Further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of this method. \",\n\"Analysis of the Limits and Potential of Web Infoveillance During COVID-19 Pandemic and for Future Research[SEP]Background: Alongside the COVID-19 pandemic, government authorities around the world have had to face a growing infodemic capable of causing serious damages to public health and economy.

It also shows toxicity against cancer cells and pathogenic microorganisms including bacteria, fungi, and virus. The purpose of this study is to assess the roles of the sialylated glycans on bLf against IAV. To this end, bLf were first treated with sodium periodate to destroy its sialylated glycans. Then, the binding activity of native or desialylated bLf with various IAV was assessed by blotting assay. Finally, their ability to inhibit IAV attachment to host cells was analyzed in vitro. Our result showed that the sialylated glycans on bLf were almost completely destroyed by sodium periodate treatment. Furthermore, the binding activity of desialylated bLf to IAV and the ability to inhibit IAV mimics binding to MDCK cells were significantly reduced compared to that of native bLf. These results demonstrated that the sialylated glycans on bLf could serve as competitive substrates to block IAV attachment to host cells during the early stages of viral infection. Our findings make an important contribute for the fully understanding of the mechanism of bLf in the prevention of IAV infections and their possible applications in antiviral infection. \",\n\"Role of sialylated glycans on bovine lactoferrin against influenza virus[SEP]Influenza is a worldwide plague caused by the influenza virus (IAV) infection, which is initiated by specific recognition with sialic acids on host cell surface.

Furthermore, the binding activity of desialylated bLf to IAV and the ability to inhibit IAV mimics binding to MDCK cells were significantly reduced compared to that of native bLf. These results demonstrated that the sialylated glycans on bLf could serve as competitive substrates to block IAV attachment to host cells during the early stages of viral infection. Our findings make an important contribute for the fully understanding of the mechanism of bLf in the prevention of IAV infections and their possible applications in antiviral infection. \"],\n [\"Community detection using unsupervised machine learning techniques on COVID-19 dataset\",\n\"has been considered to be the most destructive pandemic ever happened in the history of mankind. The worldwide research community has put a tenacious effort to carry out research on the COVID-19 to analyse its impact on economic, medical and sociolgoical fields. They are trying to solve many crucial issues related to this disease and derive strategies to deal with this global pandemic. In this paper, we have analysed the trend, countries affected regionally and the variation of cases at the country level on COVID-19 dataset. We have used the Principal component analysis on the COVID-19 dataset variables to reduce the dimensionality and find the most significant variables. Further, we have unveiled the hidden community structure of countries by applying the unsupervised clustering approach, K-means. We have compared the results with the K-means method. The communities achieved after applying the PCA are more precise. The resulted communities can be beneficial to researchers, scientists, sociologists, different policy makers and managers of health sector.

However, BoHV-4 has not been isolated or detected in mainland China prior to this study. In 2019, BoHV-4 strain 512 was isolated from cattle in Heilongjiang Province, China, using MDBK cells, and characterized by PCR, nucleotide sequence analysis, and transmission electron microscopy. Two other unknown herpesvirus strains, BL6010 and J4034, which were isolated from cattle in 2009 in China and stored at -70\\u2103, were also propagated in MDBK cells and identified as BoHV-4 by PCR. Phylogenetic analysis based on partial nucleotide sequences of the thymidine kinase (TK) gene and glycoprotein B (gB) gene for the three isolates indicated that these three Chinese strains belong to BoHV-4 genotype 1. A preliminary virus neutralization test revealed that 64% of the 70 bovine sera (45/70) collected from Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China, had anti-BoHV-4 antibodies and that natural BoHV-4 infection occurred in cattle in China. Here, we report for the first time the isolation and molecular characterization of BoHV-4 from cattle in mainland China.

These are usually evaluated later by transthoracic (TTE) or transesophageal (TEE) echocardiography. This study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of a diagnostic tool for thoracic cardiovascular thrombi according to the first experience with a new extended cardio-stroke protocol (Big 5-Jena eCS protocol) in acute stroke patients. Methods Retrospective analyses of the tomography scans database of the Jena University Hospital were performed. We included a total of 67 patients in the feasibility analyses, based on the evaluation of three outcomes. Results Primary outcome: the Big 5-Jena eCS protocol was able to detect thoracic cardiovascular thrombi in a total of 20 patients in different locations including the arch of the aorta, the aortic valve, the left atrium, the left atrial appendage, the left ventricle, and the pulmonary arteries. Secondary outcome: implementating the protocol did not result in a significant elevation of the radiation exposure compared to traditional protocols. Tertiary outcome: the new protocol identified seven cases that were considered negative by echocardiography. Conclusion The implementation of an extended cardio-stroke protocol is feasible, no significantly time-consuming, acquiring assessable imaging, and maintaining radiation exposure acceptable. The Big 5-Jena eCS protocol was also able to detect some thrombi not reported by TTE or TEE; however, due to our data's explorative character, a conclusive comparison with cardiac ultrasound is not possible. A prospective pilot study and clinical trials should be conducted to assess the diagnostic accuracy of this protocol compared to echocardiography and determine the potential impact on diagnostic and treatment decisions.

Purpose: To investigate the experiences of undergraduate nursing students during their first uses of OL to increase the understanding of their encountered opportunities and challenges. Design: A descriptive qualitative design guided by a phenomenological approach was used. Methods: The study used a purposive sampling technique to recruit 18 undergraduate nursing students from two universities. Data were collected using two focus group discussions, and the discussions with participants were audio/video recorded through the online platform Zoom due to the national imposed curfew. Content analysis employed Colaizzi's steps to derive the themes/categories. Results: The study revealed four themes: experience of helplessness, burdens, and burnout; the need for social and technical support to manage OL; the propensity to consider OL as a positive opportunity; and the deficiency of OL in fulfilling the educational outcomes of clinical courses. Conclusions: Abrupt remote OL was a challenge to clinical encounters. This format was very stressful; however, it was also useful. The current study highlighted the need for further research on the effectiveness of remote OL platforms in regard to the achievement of the intended learning outcomes of clinical courses. \",\n\"Experiences of nursing students under the unprecedented abrupt online learning format forced by the national curfew due to COVID-19: A qualitative research study[SEP]The unprecedented abrupt shift to remote online learning (OL) within the context of the national lockdown due to the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) highlights the importance of addressing students' preparedness in managing their first experiences with OL.

At the same place a standardised trapping scheme is in operation. This study reveals for the first time a positive correlation between the migratory intensity of birds aloft and the numbers of trapped birds. By relating the migratory patterns of single species with the nocturnal migratory intensities, we show that the species composition aloft can at least partly be deduced from the number of grounded birds. The numbers of trapped pre-Saharan migrants were related more strongly to the migratory intensity of the preceding night than were the numbers of trans-Saharan migrants. Assuming that the number of trapped birds varies according to the weather to the same extent as the migratory intensity of birds aloft, we conclude that in shorter range migrants the decision to engage in a migratory flight is influenced more strongly by weather conditions, and that the migratory activity of trans-Saharan migrants is possibly more intensely controlled by their endogenous migratory urge. \",\n\"Do ringing numbers reflect true migratory activity of nocturnal migrants?[SEP]In autumn 1998, nocturnal bird migration at Falsterbo was recorded over a period of three months by means of a passive infrared device.

This study is aimed at assessing the effect of an educational intervention on the improvement of circulating nurses' nontechnical skills. Methods. This semiexperimental study was conducted on 300 circulating nurses divided into the intervention and no intervention groups each containing 150 participants. The nontechnical skills were assessed using the circulating practitioners' list of nontechnical skills. Then, the intervention group received training regarding these skills, and the two groups were evaluated again. After all, the data were entered into the SPSS 24 software and were analyzed using descriptive statistics and Wilcoxon and Mann-Whitney tests.

Current consent models in Quebec were not established with the context of LHSs in mind and do not support the agility and transparency required to obtain consent from all involved, especially the citizens. Therefore, a new approach to consent is needed. Previous work identified the meta-consent model as a promising alternative to fulfill the requirements of LHSs, particularly large-scale deployments. We elicited the public's attitude toward the meta-consent model to evaluate if the model could be understood by the citizens and would be deemed acceptable to prepare for its possible implementation in Quebec. Methods: Eight focus groups, with a total of 63 members of the general public from various backgrounds were conducted in Quebec, Canada, in 2019. Explicit attention was given to literacy levels, language spoken at home and rural vs urban settings. We assessed attitudes, concerns and facilitators regarding key components of the meta-consent model: predefined categories to personalized consent requests, a dynamic web-based infrastructure to record metaconsent, and default settings. To analyse the discussions, a thematic content analysis was performed using a qualitative software. Our findings showed that participants were supportive of this new approach of consent as it promotes transparency and offers autonomy for the management of their health data. Key facilitators were identified to be considered in the implementation of a meta-consent model in the Quebec LHSs: information and transparency, awareness campaigns, development of educational tools, collaboration of front-line healthcare professionals, default settings deemed acceptable by the society as well as close partnerships with recognized and trusted institutions. Conclusions: This qualitative study reveals the openness of a sample of the Quebec population regarding the metaconsent model for secondary use of health data for research.

This first exploratory study conducted with the public is an important step in guiding decision-makers in the next phases of implementing the various strategies to support access and use of health data in Quebec. \"],\n [\"ARTICLE Dexamethasone enhances the lung metastasis of breast cancer via a PI3K-SGK1-CTGF pathway\",\n\"Dexamethasone (Dex), as a pretreatment agent, is widely used to attenuate the side effects of chemotherapy in breast cancer treatment. However, whether and how Dex affects breast cancer metastasis remain to be furtherly understood. In this study, we established several mouse breast cancer metastatic models to study the effect of Dex in vitro and in vivo. Transwell, Western Blot and RNA interference were applied to study the molecular mechanism of Dex in promoting breast cancer cell migration. Meanwhile, the effect of Dex on lung metastasis of breast cancer in Dex combined with PTX chemotherapy was discussed. Our results confirmed that Dex could promote breast cancer cell metastasis both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistic studies revealed that this pro-metastatic effect of Dex was mediated by the GR-PI3K-SGK1-CTGF pathway in tumor cells. Ligation of Dex and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) on tumor cells activated the PI3K signaling pathway and upregulated serum glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (SGK1) expression, and then increased the expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) through Nedd4l-Smad2. Moreover, Dex was the leading factor for lung metastasis in a standard regimen for breast cancer treatment with paclitaxel and Dex. Importantly, targeting SGK1 with the inhibitor GSK650394 remarkably reduced lung metastasis in this regimen. Our present data provide new insights into Dex-induced breast cancer metastasis and indicate that SGK1 could be a candidate target for the treatment of breast cancer metastasis.

Our study retrospectively assessed D-dimer levels in all virus confirmed hospitalized patients between May to September, 2020. Patients were divided into three groups: group 1 with normal D-dimer of < 0.5 \\u00b5g/mL, group 2 with elevation up to six folds, and group 3 with more than six-fold elevation. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS software 23.0. Results: Seven hundred twenty patients (group1 (n = 414), group 2 (n = 284) and group 3 (n = 22)) were studied. Eight thrombotic events were observed. Events were two with stroke, two non-ST elevation myocardial infarction and one each of ST elevation myocardial infarction, superior mesenteric artery thrombosis with bowel gangrene, arteriovenous fistula thrombus and unstable angina. No significant difference (P = 0.11) was observed between median D-dimer levels among patients who developed thrombosis (1.34) and those who did not develop thrombosis (0.91). Twenty-nine patients died. The adjusted odds of death among those with a six-fold or higher elevation in D-dimer was 128.4 (95% confidence interval (CI): 14.2 -446.3, P < 0.001), while adjusted odds of developing clinical thrombosis was 1.96 (95% CI: 0.82 -18.2, P = 0.18).

Results of this study revealed that during the early weeks of the pandemic more disadvantaged counties in the United States had a larger number of confirmed Covid-19 cases, but that over time this trend changed so that by the beginning of April, 2020 more affluent counties had more confirmed cases of the virus. The number of deaths due to Covid-19 were associated with poorer and more urban counties.

This research aims to understand whether the outbreak varies significantly between U.S. states and counties. A statistical model is estimated using publicly available outbreak data in the U.S., and regional differences are statistically analyzed. Results. There is significant variance in outbreak data between U.S. states and counties. At the state level, the outbreak rate follows a normal distribution with an average relative growth rate of 0.197 (doubling time 3.518 days).

Methods: A behavioral observation study was undertaken involving medical students at the University of New South Wales. Their face-touching behavior was observed via videotape recording. Using standardized scoring sheets, the frequency of hand-to-face contacts with mucosal or nonmucosal areas was tallied and analyzed. Results: On average, each of the 26 observed students touched their face 23 times per hour. Of all face touches, 44% (1,024/2,346) involved contact with a mucous membrane, whereas 56% (1,322/2,346) of contacts involved nonmucosal areas. Of mucous membrane touches observed, 36% (372) involved the mouth, 31% (318) involved the nose, 27% (273) involved the eyes, and 6% (61) were a combination of these regions. Conclusion: Increasing medical students' awareness of their habituated face-touching behavior and improving their understanding of self-inoculation as a route of transmission may help to improve hand hygiene compliance. Hand hygiene programs aiming to improve compliance with before and after patient contact should include a message that mouth and nose touching is a common practice.

However, direct clinical evidence linking increased inspiratory effort to lung injury is scarce. We adapted a recently developed computational simulator that replicates distinctive features of COVID-19 pathophysiology to quantify the mechanical forces that could lead to P-SILI at different levels of respiratory effort. In accordance with recent data, the simulator was calibrated to represent a spontaneously breathing COVID-19 patient with severe hypoxaemia (SaO2 80.6%) and relatively well-preserved lung mechanics (lung compliance of 47.5 ml/cmH2O), being treated with supplemental oxygen (FiO2 = 100%). Simulations were conducted at tidal volumes (VT) and respiratory rates (RR) of 7 ml/kg and 14 breaths/min (representing normal respiratory effort) and at VT/RR of 15/14, 7/20, 15/20, 10/30, 12/30, 10/35, 12/35, 10/40, 12/40 ml/kg / breaths/min. Lung compliance was unaffected by increased VT but decreased significantly at higher RR. While oxygenation improved, significant increases in multiple indicators of the potential for lung injury were observed at all higher VT/RR combinations tested. Pleural pressure swing increased from 10.1 cmH2O at baseline to 30 cmH2O at VT/RR of 15 ml/kg / 20 breaths/min and to 54.6 cmH2O at 12 ml/kg / 40 breaths/min. Dynamic strain increased from 0.3 to 0.49 at VT/RR of 12 ml/kg / 30 breaths/min, and to 0.6 at 15 ml/kg / 20 breaths/min.

Using the New World hantavirus, Andes virus, we have investigated the role of various Rab proteins in the release of hantavirus particles from infected cells. Rabs 8 and 11 were found to colocalize with Andes virus proteins in virus infected cells and when expressed from cDNA, implicating the recycling endosome as an organelle important for hantavirus infection. Small interfering RNA-mediated downregulation of Rab11a alone or Rab11a and Rab11b together resulted in a decrease in infectious virus particle secretion from infected cells. Downregulation of Rab8a did not alter infectious virus release but reduction of both isoforms did.

The clinical characteristics and impact of Mp co-detected with other bacterial and/or viral pathogens remain poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the demographic and clinical features of CAP children with Mp mono-detection and Mp co-detection. Methods: A total of 4148 hospitalized children with CAP were recruited from January to December 2017 at the Children's Hospital of Hebei Province, affiliated to Hebei Medical University. A variety of respiratory viruses, bacteria and Mp were detected using multiple modalities. The demographic and clinical features of CAP children with Mp mono-detection and Mp co-detection were recorded and analyzed. Results: Among the 110 CAP children with Mp positive, 42 (38.18%) of them were co-detected with at least one other pathogen. Co-detection was more common among children aged \\u22643 years. No significant differences were found in most clinical symptoms, complications, underlying conditions and disease severity parameters among various etiological groups, with the following exceptions. First, prolonged duration of fever, lack of appetite and runny nose were more prevalent among CAP children with Mp-virus co-detection. Second, Mp-virus (excluding HRV) co-detected patients were more likely to present with prolonged duration of fever. Third, patients co-detected with Mp-bacteria were more likely to have abnormal blood gases. Additionally, CAP children with Mp-HRV co-detection were significantly more likely to report severe runny nose compared to those with Mp mono-detection. Conclusion: Mp co-detection with viral and/or bacterial pathogens is common in clinical practice.

The clinical characteristics and impact of Mp co-detected with other bacterial and/or viral pathogens remain poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the demographic and clinical features of CAP children with Mp mono-detection and Mp co-detection. Methods: A total of 4148 hospitalized children with CAP were recruited from January to December 2017 at the Children's Hospital of Hebei Province, affiliated to Hebei Medical University. A variety of respiratory viruses, bacteria and Mp were detected using multiple modalities. The demographic and clinical features of CAP children with Mp mono-detection and Mp co-detection were recorded and analyzed. Results: Among the 110 CAP children with Mp positive, 42 (38.18%) of them were co-detected with at least one other pathogen. Co-detection was more common among children aged \\u22643 years. No significant differences were found in most clinical symptoms, complications, underlying conditions and disease severity parameters among various etiological groups, with the following exceptions. First, prolonged duration of fever, lack of appetite and runny nose were more prevalent among CAP children with Mp-virus co-detection. Second, Mp-virus (excluding HRV) co-detected patients were more likely to present with prolonged duration of fever. Third, patients co-detected with Mp-bacteria were more likely to have abnormal blood gases. Additionally, CAP children with Mp-HRV co-detection were significantly more likely to report severe runny nose compared to those with Mp mono-detection. Conclusion: Mp co-detection with viral and/or bacterial pathogens is common in clinical practice.

In last few decades, nanoscience has attracted the attention of the scientific community worldwide due to its potential uses in the pharmacy, medical diagnostics and disease treatment, energy, electronics, agriculture, chemical and space industries. The properties of nanoparticles (NPs) are size and shape dependent. These characteristic features of nanoparticles can be explored for various other applications such as computer transistors, chemical sensors, electrometers, memory schemes, reusable catalysts, biosensing, antimicrobial activity, nanocomposites, medical imaging, tumor detection and drug delivery. Therefore, synthesizing nanoparticles of desired size, structure, monodispersity and morphology is crucial for the aforementioned applications. Recent advancements in nanotechnology aim at the synthesis of nanoparticles/materials using reliable, innoxious and novel ecofriendly techniques. In contrast to the traditional methods, the biosynthesis of nanoparticles of a desired nature and structure using the microbial machinery is not only quicker and safer but more environmentally friendly.

Thus, we have scrutinized the recently published data by Krogan and coworkers (2020) on the SARS-CoV-2 interactome with host cells by affinity purification in co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) in the perspective of drug repurposing. The initial work revealed the interaction between 332 human cellular reference proteins (RefProts) with the 27 viral proteins.

Due to the limited virus strains, few key mutations that would be very important with the evolutionary trends of virus genome were observed in early studies. Here, we downloaded 1809 sequence data of SARS-CoV-2 strains from GISAID before April 2020 to identify mutations and functional alterations caused by these mutations. Totally, we identified 1017 nonsynonymous and 512 synonymous mutations with alignment to reference genome NC_045512, none of which were observed in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein. On average, each of the strains could have about 1.75 new mutations each month. The current mutations may have few impacts on antibodies. Although it shows the purifying selection in whole-genome, ORF3a, ORF8 and ORF10 were under positive selection. Only 36 mutations occurred in 1% and more virus strains were further analyzed to reveal linkage disequilibrium (LD) variants and dominant mutations. As a result, we observed five dominant mutations involving three nonsynonymous mutations C28144T, C14408T and A23403G and two synonymous mutations T8782C, and C3037T. These five mutations occurred in almost all strains in April 2020. Besides, we also observed two potential dominant nonsynonymous mutations C1059T and G25563T, which occurred in most of the strains in April 2020. Further functional analysis shows that these mutations decreased protein stability largely, which could lead to a significant reduction of virus virulence. In addition, the A23403G mutation increases the spike-ACE2 interaction and finally leads to the enhancement of its infectivity. All of these proved that the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 is toward the enhancement of infectivity and reduction of virulence. \",\n\"Functional alterations caused by mutations reflect evolutionary trends of SARS-CoV-2[SEP]Since the first report of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in December 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic has spread rapidly worldwide.

Direct evidence supports the hypothesis that fusion is a rare event that starts in maturing early endosomes, is completed in late endosomes, and occurs entirely in Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1)-positive (NPC1 \\u0609 ) compartments.

Analysis of the mechanism of action of an important class of EBOV neutralizing antibodies, such as KZ52 and ZMapp, provides direct evidence that these antibodies act by inhibiting the membrane fusion. \",\n\"Chasing Ebola through the endosomal labyrinth[SEP]During virus entry, the surface glycoprotein of Ebola virus (EBOV) undergoes a complex set of transformations within the endosomal network.

To comprehensively map cell lineages in the healthy developing, pediatric and adult human gut from ten distinct anatomical regions, as well as draining lymph nodes, we used singlecell RNA-seq and VDJ analysis of roughly one third of a million cells. This reveals the presence of BEST4+ absorptive cells throughout the human intestinal tract, demonstrating the existence of this cell type beyond the colon for the first time. Furthermore, we implicate IgG sensing as a novel function of intestinal tuft cells, and link these cells to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease. We define novel glial and neuronal cell populations in the developing enteric nervous system, and predict cell-type specific expression of Hirschsprung's disease-associated genes. Finally, using a systems approach, we identify key cell players across multiple cell lineages driving secondary lymphoid tissue formation in early human development. We show that these programs are adopted in inflammatory bowel disease to recruit and retain immune cells at the site of inflammation. These data provide an unprecedented catalogue of intestinal cells, and new insights into cellular programs in development, homeostasis and disease. Here, we create a broad and deep single-cell census of the healthy human gut, encompassing around 350,000 cells from 11 distinct anatomical sites during embryonic and fetal development, childhood and adulthood. In doing so, we reveal new insights into the epithelial compartment: we identify the presence of BEST4+ enterocytes in both small and large intestine and throughout life, and define a role for IgG sensing by tuft cells in IBD. In the developing enteric nervous system, we identify multiple novel populations, and highlight cell communication networks with stromal cells via receptors and ligands associated with Hirschsprung's disease. In addition, we identify key cells and signaling networks initiating lymphoid structure formation in early human development. Interestingly, the same developmental programmes are adopted to drive recruitment of immune cells during pediatric Crohn's disease. Thus our high-resolution genomic definition of human cells and gene expression programmes across epithelial, enteric nervous system and immune compartments uncovers new insights into both rare and common diseases of the intestines. Results To investigate cellular profiles and communication networks across the intestinal tract, we performed scRNA-seq on distinct tissue regions of the second-trimester (12-17 postconception weeks (PCW)) fetal and adult (29-69 years) intestine and draining mesenteric lymph nodes (mLN) ( Figure 1A & Supplementary Fig. 1A) . In adult samples, immune (CD45+) and non-immune (CD45-) cells were separated and loaded for scRNA-seq in equivalent proportions. To represent the gut at embryonic and early postnatal life, we incorporated our previously published embryonic (6-10 PCW; small intestine, large intestine) and pediatric (4-12 years; ileal) scRNA-seq data 4 . \",\n\"Title: Cells of the human intestinal tract mapped across space and time[SEP]The cellular landscape of the human intestinal tract is dynamic throughout life, developing in utero and changing in response to functional requirements and environmental exposures.

Torsade de pointes typically occurs in bursts of self-limiting episodes with symptoms of dizziness and syncope. However, it may occasionally progress to ventricular fibrillation and sudden death. In this article, we report a case of COVID-19 patient who developed polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with torsade de pointes morphology with normal QTc interval in the setting of fever. An 81-year-old woman was admitted with symptoms of COVID-19. She was treated with hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, and doxycycline at an outside facility and finished the treatment 5 days prior to admission to our facility. Her course was complicated by atrial fibrillation with rapid ventricular response requiring cardioversion. Later, she developed two episodes of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia with TdP morphology with normal QTc. There was a correlation with fever triggering the ventricular tachycardia. We advocated aggressive fever control given the QTc was normal and stable. Following fever control, the patient remained stable and had no abnormal rhythm. COVID-19 patients are prone to different arrhythmias including life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias with normal left ventricular systolic function and normal QTc, and they should be monitored for fever and electrolyte abnormality during their hospital stay. \",\n\"Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia with a Normal QTc Interval in a Patient with COVID-19 and Fever: Case Report[SEP]Arrhythmias or conduction system disease are not the most common manifestation of COVID-19 infection in patients requiring hospital admission.

First isolated from a forest worker in Trinidad and Tobago in 1955, the arbovirus OROV has since been detected throughout the Amazon basin with an estimated 500,000 human infections over 60 years. Like other members of the family Peribunyaviridae, the viral genome exists as 3 single-stranded negative-sense RNA segments. The medium-sized segment encodes a viral glycoprotein complex (GPC) that is proteolytically processed into two viral envelope proteins, Gn and Gc, responsible for attachment and membrane fusion. There are no therapeutics or vaccines to combat OROV infection, and we have little understanding of protective immunity to infection. Here, we generated a replication competent chimeric vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), in which the endogenous glycoprotein was replaced by the GPC of OROV. Serum from mice immunized by intramuscular injection with VSV-OROV specifically neutralized wild-type OROV, and using peptide arrays we mapped multiple epitopes within an N-terminal variable region of Gc recognized by the immune sera. VSV-OROV lacking this variable region of Gc was also immunogenic in mice producing neutralizing sera that recognize additional regions of Gc. Challenge of both sets of immunized mice with wild-type OROV shows that the VSV-OROV chimeras reduce wild-type viral infection and suggest that antibodies that recognize the variable N terminus of Gc afford less protection than those that target more conserved regions of Gc. IMPORTANCE Oropouche virus (OROV), an orthobunyavirus found in Central and South America, is an emerging public health challenge that causes debilitating febrile illness. OROV is transmitted by arthropods, and increasing mobilization has the potential to significantly increase the spread of OROV globally. Despite this, no therapeutics or vaccines have been developed to combat infection. Using vesicular stomatitis (VSV) as a backbone, we developed a chimeric virus bearing the OROV glycoproteins (VSV-OROV) and tested its ability to elicit a neutralizing antibody response. Our results demonstrate that VSV-OROV produces a strong neutralizing antibody response that is at least partially targeted to the N-terminal region of Gc. Importantly, vaccination with VSV-OROV reduces viral loads in mice challenged with wild-type virus. These data provide novel evidence that targeting the OROV glycoproteins may be an effective vaccination strategy to combat OROV infection. \",\n\"Vesicular Stomatitis Virus Chimeras Expressing the Oropouche Virus Glycoproteins Elicit Protective Immune Responses in Mice[SEP]Oropouche virus (OROV) infection of humans is associated with a debilitating febrile illness that can progress to meningitis or encephalitis.

Although parathyroidectomy results in biochemical improvement in mineral metabolism, changes in bone microarchitecture as evaluated by highresolution imaging modalities are not known. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides in-depth threedimensional assessment of bone microarchitecture, as well as determination of mechanical bone strength determined by finite element analysis (FEA). Methods: We conducted a single-centre longitudinal study to evaluate changes in bone microarchitecture with MRI in patients with SHPT undergoing parathyroidectomy. MRI was performed at the distal tibia at baseline (time of parathyroidectomy) and at least 12 months following surgery. Trabecular and cortical topological parameters as well as bone mechanical competence using FEA were assessed. Results: Fifteen patients with CKD (12 male, 3 female) underwent both MRI scans at the time of surgery and at least 12 months post-surgery. At baseline, 13 patients were on dialysis, one had a functioning kidney transplant, and one was pre-dialysis with stage 5 CKD. Seven patients received a kidney transplant following parathyroidectomy prior to follow-up MRI. MRI parameters in patients at follow up were consistent with loss in trabecular and cortical bone thickness (p = 0.006 and 0.03 respectively). Patients who underwent a kidney transplant in the follow-up period had reduction in trabecular thickness (p = 0.05), whereas those who continued on dialysis had reduction in cortical thickness (p = 0.04) and mechanical bone strength on FEA (p = 0.03). Conclusion: Patients with severe SHPT requiring parathyroidectomy have persistent changes in bone microarchitecture at least 12 months following surgery with evidence of ongoing decline in trabecular and cortical thickness. \",\n\"Changes in bone microarchitecture following parathyroidectomy in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism[SEP]Background: Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) has a significant effect on bone, affecting both trabecular and cortical compartments.

Therefore, prompted by the central role of fear in psychological responses to COVID-19, the Fear of COVID-19 Scalewas developed, which is the only instrument that can assess emotional fear reactions in relation to the current pandemic. In this study, we extend research on the psychometric properties of this instrument by adopting three complementary Page 2 of 27 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2 approaches: classical test theory, Rasch analysis, and Mokken analysis.

Persistent and prolonged fear can elevate the levels of psychological distress and aggravate preexisting mental health problems. Therefore, prompted by the central role of fear in psychological responses to COVID-19, the Fear of COVID-19 Scalewas developed, which is the only instrument that can assess emotional fear reactions in relation to the current pandemic. In this study, we extend research on the psychometric properties of this instrument by adopting three complementary Page 2 of 27 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 2 approaches: classical test theory, Rasch analysis, and Mokken analysis.

To explore the influencing factors of daytime sleepiness in patients with obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) and the correlation between daytime sleepiness and pulse oxygen decline rate in patients with severe OSAHS. Methods. consecutive patients with OSAHS diagnosed by polysomnography (PSG) in our hospital were selected. All patients were grouped according to the minimum nocturnal oxygen saturation and apnea hypopnea index (AHI). ere were 33 cases in the no sleep hypoxia group, 34 cases in the mild hypoxia group, 119 cases in the moderate hypoxia group, and 60 cases in the severe hypoxia group. ere were 30 cases in the simple snoring group, 55 cases in the mild OSAHS group, 48 cases in the moderate OSAHS group, and 113 cases in the severe OSAHS group. e Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) scores of each group were compared.

With principles of social distancing, all face to face classes were suspended due to the ongoing COVID 19 pandemic [2] . Considering its implications on our students, an online teaching session was conducted every day for 12 d. We used a free version of Zoom which allows maximum of 100 participants and for time period of 40 min. Students' perceptions were collected at the end of this lecture series. Feedback responses were obtained from 77 participants. Of these, 87% (67) were post-graduate students. Participants found the sessions to be relevant to their learning needs and clinical practice [n = 75 (97%)]. Majority of the participants perceived that the sessions were tailored to their level of learning [n = 76 (99%)] and found the sessions to be interesting and enjoyable [n = 72 (95%)]. All of the participants (n = 77) felt that each pediatric sub-specialty should start their classes for postgraduates, and that online classes should be made a part of the medical postgraduate curriculum. In the open comments, participants responded that these online sessions broke monotonous routine, were a good utilization of time and the material was easy to access. They felt motivated to read on those topics and it helped them not to think of COVID and sleep peacefully. Most frequent factors hindering learning were stated as limitation on the number of participants, time limitation of the sessions, and technical faults during the conduct of sessions. These shortcomings were addressed subsequently through buying advanced version of the software that allows more time, and better opportunity to interact with students. COVID pandemic made us realize the importance of online training for our pediatric postgraduate students. Students' satisfaction levels with online learning were comparable to the previous studies [3] . Apart from gain in knowledge, the present study revealed the impact of online learning on the morale of our students by creating a diversion from the ongoing pandemic situation. We conclude that online teaching is feasible, cheap and must be made a part of the postgraduate training in India beyond the prevailing lockdown. \",\n\"Student's Perception of Online Learning during COVID Pandemic Compliance with Ethical Standards[SEP]To the Editor: Coronavirus pandemic has not only impacted human life but also impacted medical education and residency training all over [1] .

COPEP trial aims at assessing their efficacy as post-exposure ring-48 prophylaxis among adults exposed to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 49 (SARS-CoV-2). 51 COPEP is a three-arm open-label cluster-randomized trial conducted in two cantons of 52 Switzerland. Asymptomatic adult (\\u226518 years) contacts of individuals diagnosed with COVID-53 19 will be randomized (1:1:1) to: a single-dose hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) 800mg, 54 lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) (400mg/100mg twice daily) for 5 days, or a standard of care arm 55 (no treatment). Contacts living in the single household will form a cluster and will be 56 randomized into the same arm. All participants will be followed-up for 21 days and undergo 57 daily monitoring for COVID-19 symptoms. The primary endpoint is 21-day incidence of 58 COVID-19, analyzed in an intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. The secondary endpoints include 59 the 21-day incidence of COVID-19 as well as SARS-CoV-2 infection in a modified ITT 60 analysis, excluding participants who had a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR (polymerase 61 chain reaction) from oropharyngeal swab and/or a positive SARS-CoV-2 IgG serology at 62 baseline.

Since the beginning of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 85 outbreak in December 2019, the medical and scientific community has scrambled to identify 86 effective pharmacological candidates for its prevention and treatment. Coronavirus Disease-87 19 (COVID-19, which is the clinical manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection) has caused 88 unprecedented pressure on modern health systems across the world. The sudden and 89 uncontrolled influx of severe COVID-19 cases has caused critical shortage of hospital-based 90 resources and forced many countries into lockdown in early 2020. Containing the COVID-19 pandemic may necessitate a multi-pronged strategy, 92 including immunization, treatment, and prophylaxis. The latter would facilitate the containment 93 of future outbreaks of the disease in non-immunized populations. This current pandemic wave 94 will likely be followed by subsequent outbreaks and authorities will need to consider less strict 95 isolation measures when apprising multiple economic impacts (including on health-related 96 outcome) over a prolonged period of time. Two drugs have been identified as possible prophylactic candidates; 98 hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), an anti-malarial drug 1 and the protease inhibitors 99 lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) used for the treatment of HIV. 2,3 HCQ acts as an endosomal 100 acidification fusion inhibitor and thus may blocks, at least in vitro, viral entry into the host cell. 4 101 Protease inhibitors work by preventing viral replication and LPV/r has been shown to bind to 102 active site of the SARS-CoV protease in vitro, with studies confirming that the spatial structure 103 of the binding site was conserved between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. 5-7 Both drugs are 104 licensed in most countries, are part of the World Health Organization essential list, and are 105 available globally and at low cost. 8 106 However, to date there are no published randomized studies assessing the efficacy of 107 HCQ or LPV/r as prophylaxis for COVID-19. COPEP is a Swiss three-arm open-label cluster 108 randomized trial that will assess the efficacy, safety and acceptability of same-day HCQ-and 109 LPV/r-based prophylaxis, compared to standard of care alone (no treatment) for asymptomatic 110 individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2. COPEP is an open-label three-arm (1:1:1) cluster randomized superiority trial to assess 113 efficacy, safety and acceptability of same-day HCQ-prophylaxis and same-day LPV/r-114 prophylaxis versus standard of care (no treatment) for asymptomatic adult individuals exposed 115 to SARS-CoV-2. The study will be performed at two sites in Switzerland, Geneva and Basel, 116 and seeks to recruit 420 participants over four to six months. The main objective of COPEP is 117 to assess prevention of COVID-19, with secondary objectives including preventing of SARS-118 COV-2 infection, and attenuation of COVID-19 severity. 119 120 Participants 121 This trial enrols adult individuals (\\u226518 years) who have come into close contact with a 122 confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A close contact is defined as a person who spent 123 >15 minutes in < 2 meter distance or shared closed space with a confirmed case for a 124 prolonged period (e.g. more than 2 hours) in the period extending from 48 hours before onset 125 of symptoms (or before date of testing in absence of symptoms), or a person who had direct 126 contact with the body fluids or laboratory specimens of a case without recommended personal 127 protective equipment (PPE) or in case of failure of PPE. \",\n\"Efficacy of pragmatic same-day ring prophylaxis for adult individuals exposed to 2 SARS-CoV-2 in Switzerland (COPEP): protocol of an open-label cluster randomized 3 trial 4 5[SEP]40 COPEP is a three-arm cluster randomized open-label clinical trial to test the efficacy of 41 hydroxychloroquine and of lopinavir/ritonavir versus the standard of care as post-exposure 42 ring prophylaxis for adults exposed to SARS-CoV-2.

Coronavirus Disease-87 19 (COVID-19, which is the clinical manifestation of SARS-CoV-2 infection) has caused 88 unprecedented pressure on modern health systems across the world. The sudden and 89 uncontrolled influx of severe COVID-19 cases has caused critical shortage of hospital-based 90 resources and forced many countries into lockdown in early 2020. Containing the COVID-19 pandemic may necessitate a multi-pronged strategy, 92 including immunization, treatment, and prophylaxis. The latter would facilitate the containment 93 of future outbreaks of the disease in non-immunized populations. This current pandemic wave 94 will likely be followed by subsequent outbreaks and authorities will need to consider less strict 95 isolation measures when apprising multiple economic impacts (including on health-related 96 outcome) over a prolonged period of time. Two drugs have been identified as possible prophylactic candidates; 98 hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), an anti-malarial drug 1 and the protease inhibitors 99 lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) used for the treatment of HIV. 2,3 HCQ acts as an endosomal 100 acidification fusion inhibitor and thus may blocks, at least in vitro, viral entry into the host cell. 4 101 Protease inhibitors work by preventing viral replication and LPV/r has been shown to bind to 102 active site of the SARS-CoV protease in vitro, with studies confirming that the spatial structure 103 of the binding site was conserved between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. 5-7 Both drugs are 104 licensed in most countries, are part of the World Health Organization essential list, and are 105 available globally and at low cost. 8 106 However, to date there are no published randomized studies assessing the efficacy of 107 HCQ or LPV/r as prophylaxis for COVID-19. COPEP is a Swiss three-arm open-label cluster 108 randomized trial that will assess the efficacy, safety and acceptability of same-day HCQ-and 109 LPV/r-based prophylaxis, compared to standard of care alone (no treatment) for asymptomatic 110 individuals exposed to SARS-CoV-2. COPEP is an open-label three-arm (1:1:1) cluster randomized superiority trial to assess 113 efficacy, safety and acceptability of same-day HCQ-prophylaxis and same-day LPV/r-114 prophylaxis versus standard of care (no treatment) for asymptomatic adult individuals exposed 115 to SARS-CoV-2. The study will be performed at two sites in Switzerland, Geneva and Basel, 116 and seeks to recruit 420 participants over four to six months. The main objective of COPEP is 117 to assess prevention of COVID-19, with secondary objectives including preventing of SARS-118 COV-2 infection, and attenuation of COVID-19 severity. 119 120 Participants 121 This trial enrols adult individuals (\\u226518 years) who have come into close contact with a 122 confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A close contact is defined as a person who spent 123 >15 minutes in < 2 meter distance or shared closed space with a confirmed case for a 124 prolonged period (e.g. more than 2 hours) in the period extending from 48 hours before onset 125 of symptoms (or before date of testing in absence of symptoms), or a person who had direct 126 contact with the body fluids or laboratory specimens of a case without recommended personal 127 protective equipment (PPE) or in case of failure of PPE. \"],\n [\"Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa, West End Towers, 4th Floor, PO Box 66773\",\n\"1 Demand for rice consumption in Africa has outstripped the current local production capacities.

It is also likely that the major Asian rice exporting countries will resort to stockpiling of their local production, and restrict volumes of (or ban) rice exportation. Such measures could affect demand-supply dynamics and trigger a price crisis in African rice markets.

The remote neurology program at Las Higueras Hospital in Talcahuano (HHT) was implemented in 2015 to decrease the number of patients waiting for their first appointment. Methods: This retrospective study analyzed a cohort of 2,904 ambulatory patients evaluated in the teleneurology program at the HHT between 2015 and 2019 who were referred from 16 primary and 3 tertiary healthcare centers. Results: Out of the 2,904 patients included in the study, 1,020 patients (35%) were male, and 1,884 (65%) were female. In total, 1,346 (46.0%) patients were under 60 years old (408 male and 938 female), and 1,558 (54%) were over 60 years old (612 male and 946 female). The patients were referred to a neurologist in the teleneurology program from different primary healthcare centers (93.5%) and tertiary healthcare centers (6.5%). The most common diseases diagnosed through teleneurology were, in decreasing order, headache (29.4%), Alzheimer's disease and other dementias (15.9%), and epilepsy (11.4%). From July 2018, we analyzed the patients' destination after the first teleneurology consultation. In the cohort of 634 patients who had their first consultation via the teleneurology program, 547 (86.3%) were instructed to continue follow-up via telemedicine. Conclusions: Data from this study show, for the first time in Chile, the significant contribution of the teleneurology program at the HHT to the diagnosis of a broad range of diseases in a substantial number of patients referred from primary and tertiary healthcare centers. \",\n\"Characterization of the Teleneurology Patients at the Hospital Las Higueras de Talcahuano-Chile[SEP]Background: Chile has a shortage of medical experts, including neurologists.

Our findings demonstrate that PSV uses caveolae-dependent endocytosis as the predominant entry portal into PK-15 cells which requires low pH, dynamin, Rab7 and Rab11. \"],\n [\"Role of MicroRNA in Endothelial Dysfunction and Hypertension\",\n\"Purpose of Review Hypertension is either a cause or a consequence of the endothelial dysfunction and a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). In vitro and in vivo studies established that microRNAs (miRNAs) are decisive for endothelial cell gene expression and function in various pathological conditions associated with CVD. This review provides an overview of the miRNA role in controlling the key connections between endothelial dysfunction and hypertension. Recent Findings Herein we summarize the present understanding of mechanisms underlying hypertension and its associated endothelial dysfunction as well as the miRNA role in endothelial cells with accent on the modulation of renin-angiotensin-aldosterone-system, nitric oxide, oxidative stress and on the control of vascular inflammation and angiogenesis in relation to endothelial dysfunction in hypertension. In particular, latest insights in the identification of endothelialspecific microRNAs and their targets are added to the understanding of miRNA significance in hypertension. Summary This comprehensive knowledge of the role of miRNAs in endothelial dysfunction and hypertension and of molecular mechanisms proposed for miRNA actions may offer novel diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for controlling hypertension-associated endothelial dysfunction and other cardiovascular complications. \",\n\"Role of MicroRNA in Endothelial Dysfunction and Hypertension[SEP]Purpose of Review Hypertension is either a cause or a consequence of the endothelial dysfunction and a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD).

Although generally safe when used for approved indications such as autoimmune disease or malaria, the safety and benefit of these treatment regimens are poorly evaluated in COVID-19. We did a multinational registry analysis of the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine with or without a macrolide for treatment of COVID-19. The registry comprised data from 671 hospitals in six continents. We included patients hospitalised between Dec 20, 2019, and April 14, 2020, with a positive laboratory finding for SARS-CoV-2. Patients who received one of the treatments of interest within 48 h of diagnosis were included in one of four treatment groups (chloroquine alone, chloroquine with a macrolide, hydroxychloroquine alone, or hydroxychloroquine with a macrolide), and patients who received none of these treatments formed the control group. Patients for whom one of the treatments of interest was initiated more than 48 h after diagnosis or while they were on mechanical ventilation, as well as patients who received remdesivir, were excluded.

We developed consensus statements to guide clinicians managing lung cancer screening programs and patients with lung nodules during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: An expert panel of 24 members, including pulmonologists (17), thoracic radiologists (5), and thoracic surgeons (2) was formed. The panel was provided with an overview of current evidence, summarized by recent guidelines related to lung cancer screening and lung nodule evaluation. The panel was convened by video teleconference to discuss then vote on statements related to 12 common clinical scenarios. A pre-defined threshold of 70% of panel members voting agree or strongly agree was used to determine if there was a consensus for each statement. Items that may influence decisions were listed as notes to be considered for each scenario. Results: Twelve statements related to baseline and annual lung cancer screening (2), surveillance of a previously detected lung nodule (5), evaluation of intermediate and high risk lung nodules (4), and management of clinical stage I non-small cell lung cancer (1) were developed and modified. All 12 statements were confirmed as consensus statements by voting results. The consensus statements provide guidance about situations where it was felt to be appropriate to delay screening, defer surveillance imaging of lung nodules, and minimize non-urgent interventions during the evaluation of lung nodules and stage I non-small cell lung cancer.

Death education is a type of intervention that helps people manage their fear of death by offering them effective strategies to deal with loss and anxiety. To that end, a path of death education has been carried out with University students of psychology. The main purpose of the research is to understand how students who participated in the death education course perceive the lockdown experience in light of course teachings. The research was carried out at a University in northern Italy in an area severely affected by COVID-19, during the first year of the pandemic. The group of participants included 38 students, 30 women and 8 men, with an average age of 25.45 years (SD = 7). At the end of the course, the students could respond on an optional basis to the request to comment on the training experience according to what they experienced during the pandemic. A thematic analysis was subsequently carried out on the texts, which made it possible to identify the most relevant thematic areas for the students. The qualitative analyses permitted recognition of three main forms of discovery: the removal of death in contemporary culture; the importance of community, ritual and funeral, and spirituality; and the significance of death education for future health professionals. The texts have highlighted how the removal of these issues exposes people to the risk of being unable to handle extremely painful events such as those related to dying.

Faculty and residents identified a need for clear, relevant, and specific competencies to frame teaching, learning, supervision and feedback during the pandemic. A rapid, iterative, educational quality improvement process was launched. Phase 1 involved experienced educators defining gaps in our program's existing competency-database, reviewing emerging public health and regulatory guidelines, and drafting competencies. Phase 2 involved translation, member-checking, and anonymous feedback and editing of draft competencies by residents and other educational leaders. Phase 3 involved wider dissemination, collaborative editing and feedback from residents and faculty throughout the department. Results: A total of 44 physicians including residents and faculty from multiple contexts provided detailed feedback, review, and editing of an ultimate list of 33 competencies organized by CanMEDS-FM roles. Broad agreement was obtained that the competencies form reasonable learning outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Phase 3 involved wider dissemination, collaborative editing and feedback from residents and faculty throughout the department. Results: A total of 44 physicians including residents and faculty from multiple contexts provided detailed feedback, review, and editing of an ultimate list of 33 competencies organized by CanMEDS-FM roles. Broad agreement was obtained that the competencies form reasonable learning outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusions: These competencies represent learning objectives reflecting the initial educational mindsets of a wide range of teachers and learners experiencing a global pandemic. The project illustrates a novel collaboration across educational portfolios as a rapid educational response to a public health crisis.

Cautions regarding ecological studies of COVID-19\",\n\"Several ecological studies of the coronavirus disease 2019 have reported correlations between group-level aggregated exposures and COVID-19 outcomes. While some studies might be helpful in generating new hypotheses related to COVID-19, results of such type of studies should be interpreted with cautions. To illustrate how ecological studies and results could be biased, we conducted an ecological study of COVID-19 outcomes and the distance to Brussels using European country-level data. We found that, the distance was negatively correlated with COVID-19 outcomes; every 100 km away from Brussels was associated with approximately 6% to 17% reductions (all P<0.01) in COVID-19 cases and deaths in Europe. Without cautions, such results could be interpreted as the closer to the Europe Union headquarters, the higher risk of COVID-19 in Europe. However, these results are more likely to reflect the differences in the timing of and the responding to the outbreak, etc. between European countries, rather than the 'effect' of the distance to Brussels itself. Associations observed at the group level have limitations to reflect individual-level associations -the so-called ecological fallacy. Given the public concern over COVID-19, ecological studies should be conducted and interpreted with great cautions, in case the results would be mistakenly understood. \",\n\"The closer to the Europe Union headquarters, the higher risk of COVID-19?

Methods: The medical and billing records of a large academic private practice were electronically queried for all cases of PPV for retinal detachment performed between January 1, 2017 and December 31, 2017. The preoperative consultation, operative report, and POD1 and POW1 (postoperative days 5-14) visits were reviewed. Main Outcome Measures: Incidence of unexpected management changes (change in or extended positioning, additional procedure, change in drop regimen, or shortened interval follow-up) at the POD1 visit after uncomplicated PPV for retinal detachment. Results: Overall, 418 surgeries from 364 eyes and 355 patients were included. Eleven cases (2.6%) had an intraocular pressure (IOP) over 30 mmHg at POD1. IOP lowering drops were prescribed for 30 cases (7.2%). Silicone oil tamponade was positively associated with high IOP at POD1 (RR = 3.23, 95% CI 0.96 -10.84, P = 0.06). No additional management changes were made besides treating elevated IOP. Conclusions: Management changes POD1 after vitrectomy for retinal detachment repair are relatively uncommon and were solely IOP related in this patient group. There may be flexibility regarding the type of POD1 encounter necessary, including an IOP check with an ophthalmic technician or non-retinal eye care provider.

Currently, the H5N1 avian flu virus is limited to outbreaks among poultry and persons in direct contact to infected poultry, but the mortality rate among infected humans is high. Avian influenza (AI) is endemic in Asia as a result of unregulated poultry rearing in rural areas. Such birds often live in close proximity to humans and this increases the chance of genetic re-assortment between avian and human influenza viruses which may produce a mutant strain that is easily transmitted between humans. Once this happens, a global pandemic is likely. Unlike SARS, a person with influenza infection is contagious before the onset of case-defining symptoms which limits the effectiveness of case isolation as a control strategy. Researchers have shown that carefully orchestrated of public health measures could potentially limit the spread of an AI pandemic if implemented soon after the first cases appear.

However, little is known about this construct in the healthcare population. Objectives: To describe MiL among healthcare professionals employed in palliative care and neuro-rehabilitation medicine, unveiling possible differences related to medical specialty and socio-demographic characteristics. Methods: In this cross-sectional and multicentre study, palliative care and neuro-rehabilitation professionals were recruited. MiL was evaluated with the Schedule for Meaning in Life Evaluation (SMiLE), which provides a list of meaningful areas, as well as related overall indexes of satisfaction (IoS), weighting (IoW), weighted satisfaction (IoWS). Descriptive statistics, t-test, chi-square, linear and binary logistic regressions were performed. Results: Overall, 297 healthcare professionals (palliative care=89, neuro-rehabilitation medicine=208, 47% of participants \\u2264 40 years old) completed the evaluation. The sample was intra-and inter-groups heterogeneous, in particular concerning age and professional role. Conversely, no significant group differences emerged in MiL indexes comparisons, nor in the number of MiL listed areas. As for MiL areas, the category \\\"family\\\" increased the IoWS index, while terms related to \\\"finances\\\" contributed to decrease it. Comparing specialties, palliative care professionals were more likely to report areas like \\\"partnership\\\", \\\"social commitment\\\", and \\\"satisfaction\\\".

However, little is known about this construct in the healthcare population. Objectives: To describe MiL among healthcare professionals employed in palliative care and neuro-rehabilitation medicine, unveiling possible differences related to medical specialty and socio-demographic characteristics. Methods: In this cross-sectional and multicentre study, palliative care and neuro-rehabilitation professionals were recruited. MiL was evaluated with the Schedule for Meaning in Life Evaluation (SMiLE), which provides a list of meaningful areas, as well as related overall indexes of satisfaction (IoS), weighting (IoW), weighted satisfaction (IoWS). Descriptive statistics, t-test, chi-square, linear and binary logistic regressions were performed. Results: Overall, 297 healthcare professionals (palliative care=89, neuro-rehabilitation medicine=208, 47% of participants \\u2264 40 years old) completed the evaluation. The sample was intra-and inter-groups heterogeneous, in particular concerning age and professional role. Conversely, no significant group differences emerged in MiL indexes comparisons, nor in the number of MiL listed areas. As for MiL areas, the category \\\"family\\\" increased the IoWS index, while terms related to \\\"finances\\\" contributed to decrease it. Comparing specialties, palliative care professionals were more likely to report areas like \\\"partnership\\\", \\\"social commitment\\\", and \\\"satisfaction\\\". Nurses (n=116), nurse aides (n=47), and therapists (n=67) were more likely to mention health-related terms (e.g. health, physical wellbeing) than physicians and psychologists (n=65).

After being infected by SARS-CoV-2, a specific humoral immune response may be rapidly induced in the host to restrain the viral infection via the production of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs), which are also useful for preventing reinfection [1, 2]. However, there is a lack of comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying SARS-CoV-2 specific humoral immunity and alterations in immunoglobulin M (IgM) and G (IgG) levels in humans during viral infection. In this perspective, we have summarized several characteristics of the humoral immune response against SARS-CoV-2 infection and its potentially critical role in vaccine development. Additionally, we have discussed the antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) phenomenon in antibody immunotherapy, the current status of vaccine development, and public health strategies aimed at ending the global COVID-19 pandemic. Since the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was reported as the causative agent of COVID-19 in December 2019, the subsequent spread of SARS-CoV-2 has led to the COVID-19 pandemic.

O-Acetylation is an important modification of the sialic acids, however very few studies have demonstrated the in situ distribution of the O-Acetylated sialic acids. Here the distribution of glycoprotein bound 4-O-Acetylated sialic acids (4-O-Ac sias) in vertebrates was determined using a novel virus histochemistry assay. The 4-O-Ac sias were found in the circulatory system, i.e. on the surface of endothelial cells and RBCs, of several vertebrate species, though most frequently in the cartilaginous fish (class Chondrichthyes) and the bony fish (class Osteichthyes). The O-Acetylated sialic acid was detected in 64 % of the examined fish species. Even though the sialic acid was found less commonly in higher vertebrates, it was found at the same location in the positive species. The general significance of this endothelial labelling pattern distribution is discussed. The seemingly conserved local position through the evolution of the vertebrates, suggests an evolutionary advantage of this sialic acid modification. \",\n\"The in situ distribution of glycoprotein-bound 4-O-Acetylated sialic acids in vertebrates[SEP]Sialic acids are located at the terminal branches of the cell glycocalyx and secreted glycan molecules.

In this paper, we leverage a computational approach recently developed by our group to study the interactions between nanoparticles and mammalian membranes to study the time of entry of a variety of drugs into the viral envelope of coronavirus as well as cellular organelles. Using a combination of all-atoms molecular dynamics simulations and statistical analysis, we consider both drug characteristics and membrane properties to determine the behavior of 79 drugs and their interactions with the viral envelope, composed of the membrane and spike protein, as well as five other membranes that correspond to various mammalian compartments (lysosome, plasma, Golgi, mitochondrial, and endoplasmic reticulum membranes). The results highlight important trends that can be exploited for drug design, from the relatively high permeability of the viral envelope and the effect of transmembrane proteins, to the differences in permeability between organelles. When compared with bioavailability data present in the literature, the model results suggest a negative correlation between time of permeation and bioavailability of promising drugs. The method is general and flexible and can be employed for a variety of molecules, from small drugs to small nanoparticles, as well to a variety of biological membranes. Overall, the results indicate that this model can contribute to the identification of successful drugs as it predicts the ability of compounds to reach both intended and unintended intracellular targets. \",\n\"On Drug-Membrane Permeability of Antivirals for SARS-CoV-2[SEP]One of the key parameters required to identify effective drugs is membrane permeability, as a compound intended for an intracellular target with poor permeability will have low efficacy.

Our goal was to evaluate for discordance in SARS-CoV-2 detection in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and tracheostomies based on the site analyzed. Study Design: Retrospective chart review Methods: This single-institution study evaluated hospitalized patients with COVID-19 who had tracheostomies placed during their treatment. We analyzed SARS-CoV-2 RNA nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) results after tracheostomy. All included patients had nasopharyngeal (NP) and tracheal (TR) samples taken within a 48-hour period, allowing us to characterize rate of test concordance. Results: Forty-five patients met our inclusion criteria. Thirty-two (71.1%) patients had entirely concordant results after tracheostomy. However, 13 (28.9%) patients had at least one set of discordant results, the majority of which were NP negative and TR positive. There were no statistically significant differences in demographic or clinical variables, including time to tracheostomy and time to testing, among patients with concordant versus discordant SARS-CoV-2 results. Conclusion: This represents the first study to examine SARS-CoV-2 RNA NAAT concordance between NP and TR sites in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 and tracheostomies. One-third of patients demonstrated discordant testing when NP and TR specimens were collected within a 48-hour time period.

We present the feasibility and outcome of a community-based HPV self-sampled screening program. Methods: In Ile Ife, Nigeria, 9406 women aged 30-49 years collected vaginal self-samples, which were tested for HPV in the local study laboratory using Hybrid Capture-2 (HC2) (Qiagen). HPV-positive women were referred to the colposcopy clinic. Gynecologist colposcopic impression dictated immediate management; biopsies were taken when definite acetowhitening was present to produce a histopathologic reference standard of precancer (and to determine final clinical management). Retrospective linkage to the medical records identified 442 of 9406 women living with HIV (WLWH). Results: With self-sampling, it was possible to screen more than 100 women per day per clinic. Following an audiovisual presentation and in-person instructions, overall acceptability of self-sampling was very high (81.2% women preferring self-sampling over clinician collection). HPV positivity was found in 17.3% of women. Intensive follow-up contributed to 85.9% attendance at the colposcopy clinic. Of those referred, 8.2% were initially treated with thermal ablation and 5.6% with large loop excision of transformation zone (LLETZ). Full visibility of the squamocolumnar junction, necessary for optimal visual triage and ablation, declined from 68.5% at age 30 to 35.4% at age 49. CIN2+ and CIN3+ (CIN-Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia), including five cancers, were identified by histology in 5.9 and 3.2% of the HPV-positive women, respectively (0.9 and 0.5% of the total screening population), leading to additional treatment as indicated. The prevalences of HPV infection and CIN2+ were substantially higher (40.5 and 2.5%, respectively) among WLWH. Colposcopic impression led to over-and under-treatment compared to the histopathology reference standard.

Of particular concern is the prevalence of opioid use among emerging adults (ages 18-25), as this is a developmental period of heightened vulnerability and critical social, neurological, and psychological development. Data from 2015 show that American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) people have the highest rates of diagnosis for opioid use disorders (OUDs). One recent study found that the overdose death rate among urban-dwelling AI/AN individuals was 1.4 times higher compared to those living in rural areas. To date, there are no evidence-based prevention programs addressing opioid use among urban AI/AN emerging adults that integrate culturally-appropriate strategies with evidence-based treatment. Traditions and Connections for Urban Native Americans (TACUNA) builds on our prior work with AI/AN communities across California to develop and evaluate culturally appropriate programming to address opioid, alcohol, and cannabis use among urban AI/AN emerging adults. Methods/design: In a randomized controlled trial, 18-25 year old urban AI/AN emerging adults will receive either TACUNA (n = 185), which comprises three virtual workshops utilizing motivational interviewing, social network visualization, and integrating traditional practices and a wellness circle, or one virtual culturally sensitive opioid education workshop (n = 185).

Collectively, we elucidate the biological roles of m 6 A modifications in NK cells and highlight a new direction to harness NK cell anti-tumor immunity. immunity downstream factor of IL-15 in NK cells, has four binding sites within 2 Kb upstream of the YTHDF2 regulates the responsiveness of NK cells to IL-15, especially under some conditions enriched in protein translation, RNA binding, and RNA splicing (Fig. S5 G). \"],\n [\"Journal Pre-proofs SARS-CoV-2 infection and impact on female genital tract: an untested hy- pothesis SARS-CoV-2 infection and impact on female genital tract: an untested hypothesis\",\n\"COVID pandemic consists one of the most challenging medical realities.

One of the critical steps in comparing transcription profiles is accurate normalisation. In most of the studies published on realtime PCR in horses, normalisation occurred against only one reference gene, usually GAPDH or ACTB, without validation of its expression stability. This might result in unreliable conclusions, because it has been demonstrated that the expression levels of so called \\\"housekeeping genes\\\" may vary considerably in different tissues, cell types or disease stages, particularly in clinical samples associated with malignant disease. The goal of this study was to establish a reliable set of reference genes for studies concerning normal equine skin and equine sarcoids, which are the most common skin tumour in horses. In the present study the gene transcription levels of 6 commonly used reference genes (ACTB, B2M, HPRT1, UBB, TUBA1 and RPL32) were determined in normal equine skin and in equine sarcoids. After applying the geNorm applet to this set of genes, TUBA1, ACTB and UBB were found to be most stable in normal skin and B2M, ACTB and UBB in equine sarcoids. Based on these results, TUBA1, ACTB and UBB, respectively B2M, ACTB and UBB can be proposed as reference gene panels for accurate normalisation of quantitative data for normal equine skin, respectively equine sarcoids. When normal skin and equine sarcoids are compared, the use of the geometric mean of UBB, ACTB and B2M can be recommended as a reliable and accurate normalisation factor. \",\n\"Selection of a set of reliable reference genes for quantitative real-time PCR in normal equine skin and in equine sarcoids[SEP]Background: Real-time quantitative PCR can be a very powerful and accurate technique to examine gene transcription patterns in different biological conditions.

Current methods that permit the assembly of DNA circuits in mammalian cells are laborious, slow, expensive and mostly not permissive of rapid prototyping of constructs. Here we present the Mammalian ToolKit (MTK), a Golden Gate-based cloning toolkit for fast, reproducible and versatile assembly of large DNA vectors and their implementation in mammalian models. The MTK consists of a curated library of characterized, modular parts that can be easily mixed and matched to combinatorially assemble one transcriptional unit with different characteristics, or a hierarchy of transcriptional units weaved into complex circuits. MTK renders many cell engineering operations facile, as showcased by our ability to use the toolkit to generate single-integration landing pads, to create and deliver libraries of protein variants and sgRNAs, and to iterate through Cas9-based prototype circuits. As a biological proof of concept, we used the MTK to successfully design and rapidly construct in mammalian cells a challenging multicistronic circuit encoding the Ebola virus (EBOV) replication complex. This construct provides a non-infectious biosafety level 2 (BSL2) cellular assay for exploring the transcription and replication steps of the EBOV viral life cycle in its host. Its construction also demonstrates how the MTK can enable important and time sensitive applications such as the rapid testing of pharmacological inhibitors of emerging BSL4 viruses that pose a major threat to human health. and Extensible Mammalian Modular Assembly kit (EMMA) 3 based on Golden Gate assembly reactions were proposed. Both methods use sets of modular parts with given functionality, which can be assembled directionally into transcription units (TUs) by type-IIS restriction enzymes. While useful, all three methods have important shortcomings. GMAP requires sequencing in between all cloning steps, which makes the method slow and expensive. EMMA and mMoClo provide a method to hierarchically assemble DNA vectors that encode large circuits, but fall short on shareability, integration of Cas9 sgRNA cloning, a library of tested parts, and ease of use. While in yeast and plant systems, methods for the rapid, efficient and hierarchical assembly of genetic circuits from a large library of well described modular parts [8] [9] [10] [11] exist, we are unaware that such a cloning toolkit for mammalian systems is readily available. In this work, we adapted the modular cloning strategy (MoClo) 12 strategy to build mammalian expression vectors. The Mammalian ToolKit (MTK) is a library of over 300 parts including vetted promoters, 3'UTRs, fluorescent proteins, insulator and P2A elements that can be combined to build large genetic circuits in a rapid and efficient fashion. These vectors can be delivered to a wide range of cell types, through viral, recombinase and CRISPR/Cas9 methods. As a proof of concept, we built a hAAVS1 landing pad for single integration of genetic circuits, created and delivered libraries of protein variants and sgRNAs and rapidly compared multi-species Cas9-based genetic circuits. Finally, we used Ebola virus (EBOV) as a test case to address an emerging need to streamline the generation of BSL2 reagents during outbreaks of novel BSL4 viruses. Using the MTK, we rapidly built a non-infectious multicistronic ribonucleoprotein expression system for EBOV in a mammalian host. This system recapitulates the transcription and replication sub-lifecycle of the virus in a mammalian host, and can therefore be used to accelerate the study of viral biology and discovery of antiviral molecules. \",\n\"A Toolkit for Rapid Modular Construction of Biological Circuits in Mammalian Cells[SEP]The ability to rapidly assemble and prototype cellular circuits is vital for biological research and its applications in biotechnology and medicine.

Results: A total of 307 cases were included in our study. The mean gestational weeks of the neonates hospitalized in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit during the COVID-19 period were higher than those in the control group (p: 0.003). During the pandemic period, an increase was found in the frequency of pregnant women presenting to obstetric emergency services in emergencies requiring acute intervention (p: 0.01). Compared to the control group, there was an increase in the number of infants with small for gestational age (SGA) diagnosis, 5th-minute Apgar score of <7, and newborns with a diagnosis of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy who were treated with hypothermia in the study group (p <0.05). No difference was found in terms of maternal and neonatal mortality (p >0.05).

The aim of this study was to identify the perceived barriers to veterinary infection control and HeV management in private veterinary practice in Queensland, where the majority of HeV outbreaks have occurred in Australia. Results: Most participants agreed that a number of key factors had contributed to the slow uptake of adequate infection control measures for the management of HeV amongst private veterinarians: a work culture characterised by suboptimal infection control standards and misconceptions about zoonotic risks; a lack of leadership and support from government authorities; the difficulties of managing biosecurity and public health issues from a private workforce perspective; and the slow pattern of emergence of HeV. By 2010, some infection control and HeV management changes had been implemented. Participants interviewed agreed that further improvements remained necessary; but also cautioned that this was a complex process which would require time. Conclusion: Private veterinarians and government authorities prior to 2009 were unprepared to handle new slowly emerging zoonoses, which may explain their mismanagement of HeV. Slowly emerging zoonoses may be of low public health significance but of high significance for specialised groups such as veterinarians. Private veterinarians, who are expected to fulfil an active biosecurity and public health role in the frontline management of such emerging zoonoses, need government agencies to better recognise their contribution, to consult with the veterinary profession when devising guidelines for the management of zoonoses and to provide them with greater leadership and support. We propose that specific infection control guidelines for the management of slowly emerging zoonoses in private veterinary settings need to be developed. \",\n\"Management of the slowly emerging zoonosis, Hendra virus, by private veterinarians in Queensland, Australia: a qualitative study[SEP]Background: Veterinary infection control for the management of Hendra virus (HeV), an emerging zoonosis in Australia, remained suboptimal until 2010 despite 71.4% (5/7) of humans infected with HeV being veterinary personnel or assisting a veterinarian, three of whom died before 2009. The aim of this study was to identify the perceived barriers to veterinary infection control and HeV management in private veterinary practice in Queensland, where the majority of HeV outbreaks have occurred in Australia. Results: Most participants agreed that a number of key factors had contributed to the slow uptake of adequate infection control measures for the management of HeV amongst private veterinarians: a work culture characterised by suboptimal infection control standards and misconceptions about zoonotic risks; a lack of leadership and support from government authorities; the difficulties of managing biosecurity and public health issues from a private workforce perspective; and the slow pattern of emergence of HeV. By 2010, some infection control and HeV management changes had been implemented. Participants interviewed agreed that further improvements remained necessary; but also cautioned that this was a complex process which would require time. Conclusion: Private veterinarians and government authorities prior to 2009 were unprepared to handle new slowly emerging zoonoses, which may explain their mismanagement of HeV. Slowly emerging zoonoses may be of low public health significance but of high significance for specialised groups such as veterinarians. Private veterinarians, who are expected to fulfil an active biosecurity and public health role in the frontline management of such emerging zoonoses, need government agencies to better recognise their contribution, to consult with the veterinary profession when devising guidelines for the management of zoonoses and to provide them with greater leadership and support. We propose that specific infection control guidelines for the management of slowly emerging zoonoses in private veterinary settings need to be developed. \"],\n [\"Scientific evidence on mental health in key regions under the COVID-19 pandemic -meta-analytical evidence from Africa\",\n\"This systematic review aims to summarize the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and insomnia in the general adult population and healthcare workers (HCWs) in several key regions worldwide during the first year of the COVID pandemic. Several literature databases were systemically searched for meta-analyses published by 22 September 2021 on the prevalence rates of mental health symptoms worldwide. The prevalence rates of mental health symptoms were summarized based on 388 empirical studies with a total of 1,067,021 participants from six regions and four countries. Comparatively, Africa and South Asia had the worse overall mental health symptoms, followed by Latin America. The research effort on mental health during COVID-19 has been highly skewed in terms of the scope of countries and mental health outcomes. The mental health symptoms are highly prevalent yet differ across regions, and such evidence helps to enable prioritization of mental health assistance efforts to allocate attention and resources based on the regional differences in mental health. \",\n\"Scientific evidence on mental health in key regions under the COVID-19 pandemic -meta-analytical evidence from Africa[SEP]This systematic review aims to summarize the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and insomnia in the general adult population and healthcare workers (HCWs) in several key regions worldwide during the first year of the COVID pandemic.

Based on the solubility determination and pseudo-ternary phase diagram, isopropyl palmitate (IPP) was chosen as the oil phase. Meanwhile, Cremophor RH40 and Macrogol 200 (PEG 200) were chosen as the emulsifier and co-emulsifier, respectively. This prescription was further optimized by using central composite design of response surface methodology. The optimized condition was CEP:IPP:Cremophor RH40:PEG 200=3.6:30.0:55.3:11.1 in mass ratio with maximum drug loading (36.21 mg/mL) and the minimum particle size (36.70 nm). The constructed CEP-SEDDS was characterized by dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy, in vitro release and stability studies. The dissolution level of CEP-SEDDS was nearly 100% after 30 min in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 6.8) which was higher than that of the pure CEP (approximately 20%). In addition, in vivo pharmacokinetic study in rats showed that CEP-SEDDS dramatically improved bioavailability compared with active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) (the relative bioavailability was 203.46%). In this study, CEP-SEDDS was successfully prepared to enhance the oral bioavailability which might facilitate to increase its better clinical application.

A defective redox balance has been related to viral pathogenesis developing a massive induction of cell death provoked by oxidative stress. The aim of this study is to perform a complete oxidative stress profile evaluation regarding antioxidant enzymes, total antioxidant capacity and oxidative cell damage in order to characterize its role in diagnosis and severity of this disease. Methods: Blood samples were obtained from 108 COVID-19 patients and 28 controls and metabolites representative of oxidative stress were assessed. The association between lipid peroxidation and 28-day intubation/death risk was evaluated by multivariable regression analysis. Probability of intubation/death to day-28 was analyzed by using Kaplan-Meier curves and tested with the log-rank test. : Antioxidant enzymes (Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Catalase) and oxidative cell damage (Carbonyl and Lipid peroxidation (LPO)) levels were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients while total antioxidant capacity (ABTS and FRAP) levels were lower in these patients. The comparison of oxidative stress molecules' levels across COVID-19 severity revealed that only LPO was statistically different between mild and intubated/death COVID-19 patients. COX multivariate regression analysis identified LPO levels over the OOP (LPO>1948.17 \\u00b5M) as an independent risk factor for 28-day intubation/death in COVID-19 patients [OR: 2.57; 95% CI: 1.10-5.99; p=0.029].

Prone mechanical ventilation is a therapeutic strategy which has been used extensively during the COVID-19 pandemic to treat acutely hypoxemic patients with COVID-19 related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Though a small number of cases of unilateral NAION have been reported in patients testing positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, we describe what is to our knowledge, the first reported case of bilateral NAION occurring in a patient proned extensively for the treatment of COVID-19 related ARDS. We consider the potential aetiological factors leading to NAION after prone mechanical ventilation in patients with COVID-19 and suggest strategies to protect against its development. Case presentation: : We report a case of severe, irreversible, visual impairment secondary to bilateral anterior ION in a fifty-five-year-old male who underwent eight episodes of prone mechanical ventilation to treat COVID-19 related ARDS. Once weaned from his sedation he reported bilateral painless vision loss, and bedside ophthalmological assessment identified a reduced visual acuity of 3/30 unaided in the left eye and counting fingers in the right. Dilated indirect ophthalmoscopy revealed inferotemporal optic disc oedema with splinter haemorrhages in the right eye and mild disc oedema, temporal pallor, and nerve fibre layer haemorrhages inferiorly in the left eye. Humphrey visual field 24 \\u2212 2 testing confirmed a severely constricted visual field with macular sparing on the right and depressed inferonasal vision with preserved peripheral vision on the left eye. OCT disc imaging shortly after diagnosis revealed bilateral disc swelling and flame haemorrhages in the right eye.

The CDC recommends every adult receive the annual influenza vaccine and patients with certain comorbidities receive the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23). However, vaccination rates among IBD patients remain unacceptably low. The aim of our study is to present influenza and pneumococcal vaccinations rates of IBD patients at our center. We hypothesized that vaccination rates will be suboptimal at our outpatient center and that patients are not being vaccinated based on comorbid conditions in accordance with guidelines. We retrieved electronic medical records from the gastroenterology clinic between December 2018 and December 2019. Data regarding influenza and pneumococcal vaccines, immunosuppressive drugs, and comorbidities were obtained. Microsoft Excel and SPSS Statistics (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) were used for data analyses. A pvalue < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. In total, 109 IBD patients were identified, 46.8% female and 53.2% male. The majority were African American (77.06%). The mean age was 45 years. Around 26.61% of the patients were on immunosuppressive therapy. Around 28.7% received the annual influenza vaccine, 42.2% PPSV23 alone, 19.27% PCV13 alone, and 16.5% received both. Patients >50 years were more likely to receive the influenza vaccine (P = 0.0122). Patients on immunosuppressive therapy were not more likely to be vaccinated with both PCV13 and PPSV23 (P = 0.1848, P = 0.7382).

Work from multiple laboratories has revealed that HPV has evolved a unique means to deliver its viral genome (vDNA) to the cell nucleus, relying on myriad host cell proteins and processes. The major breakthrough finding from these recent endeavors has been the realization of L2-dependent utilization of cellular sorting factors for the retrograde transport of vDNA away from degradative endo/lysosomal compartments to the Golgi, prior to mitosis-dependent nuclear accumulation of L2/vDNA. An overview of current models of HPV entry, subcellular trafficking, and the role of L2 during initial infection is provided below, highlighting unresolved questions and gaps in knowledge. L2 is thought to be physically complexed to the vDNA within viral particles, and is responsible for the intracellular transport and nuclear accumulation of the vDNA during infection [11] .

The significance of Ct values in epidemiological studies and large cohorts is still unclear. Objective: To monitor Ct values in a long-term study and compare the results with demographic data of patients who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by real-time PCR. Study design: S gene SARS-CoV-2 Ct values were analyzed retrospectively from consecutive patients between March 15th to September 15th 2020 with special regard to age, gender, and in-or outpatient status. Results: In total, 65,878 patients were tested, 1103 (1.7 %) of whom were positive for SARS-CoV-2. Twenty-six positive patients were excluded, because the respective PCR runs did not meet the stability requirements (Ct value of the positive controls between 26 and 29). Of the remaining 1077 patients, females (n = 566; 53 %) were significantly older than males (n = 511; 47 %) (50.9 versus 45.1 years; p = 0.006) and had slightly higher mean Ct values than males (25.4 vs. 24.8; p = 0.04). Patients in the age groups >80 years had significantly higher Ct values than the remaining age groups (p < 0.001). Children (0-19 years) showed Ct values in the range of those found in adults (25.2 vs. 25.1, p = 0.9). There were no statistically different Ct values between in-and outpatients (p = 0.1), however, SARS-CoV-2 positive inpatients were significantly older than outpatients (p < 0.0001).

Of the remaining 1077 patients, females (n = 566; 53 %) were significantly older than males (n = 511; 47 %) (50.9 versus 45.1 years; p = 0.006) and had slightly higher mean Ct values than males (25.4 vs. 24.8; p = 0.04). Patients in the age groups >80 years had significantly higher Ct values than the remaining age groups (p < 0.001). Children (0-19 years) showed Ct values in the range of those found in adults (25.2 vs. 25.1, p = 0.9). There were no statistically different Ct values between in-and outpatients (p = 0.1), however, SARS-CoV-2 positive inpatients were significantly older than outpatients (p < 0.0001). Conclusions: CT values are suitable for more detailed monitoring of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Age is an important cofactor in SARS-CoV-2 positive patients and may have influence on Ct values in SARS-CoV-2-PCR. \"],\n [\"Investigating the human host -ssRNA virus interaction landscape using the SMEAGOL toolbox\",\n\"Viruses are intracellular parasites that need their host cell to reproduce.

Here, we translated the isobutanol process from shake flasks to a 1-L bioreactor in order to characterize three E. coli strains. With in situ isobutanol removal from the bioreactor using gas stripping, the engineered E. coli strain (JCL260) produced more than 50 g/L in 72 h. In addition, the isobutanol production by the parental strain (JCL16) and the high isobutanol-tolerant mutant (SA481) were compared with JCL260. Interestingly, we found that the isobutanoltolerant strain in fact produced worse than either JCL16 or JCL260. This result suggests that in situ product removal can properly overcome isobutanol toxicity in E. coli cultures. The isobutanol productivity was approximately twofold and the titer was 9% higher than n-butanol produced by Clostridium in a similar integrated system. \",\n\"High-flux isobutanol production using engineered Escherichia coli: a bioreactor study with in situ product removal[SEP]Promising approaches to produce higher alcohols, e.g., isobutanol, using Escherichia coli have been developed with successful results.

Additive effect of alcohol and cannabis use on college students' neuropsychological performance\",\n\"Introduction: Binge drinking (BD) and cannabis use are prevalent in European adolescents and students. BD has been shown to have a negative impact on neuropsychological functioning, but little is known about the additive effect when it is combined with cannabis consumption. We therefore investigated the neuropsychological profiles of students who engage in combined BD and cannabis use, in order to explore the potentially harmful additive effects of cannabis use and BD on cognition. Material and methods: A sample of college students (N = 298) completed questionnaires on alcohol and cannabis use, and were screened for neuropsychological impairments using the Brief Evaluation of Alcohol-Related Neuropsychological Impairments (BEARNI). First, after dividing students into three groups according to their alcohol and cannabis use (i.e., light drinkers, binge drinkers, and binge drinkers consuming cannabis), we ran a linear mixed model based on the BEARNI z scores to test the performances of the three groups. Information yielded by the mixed model was supplemented by individual analyses. Second, to explore the heterogeneity of binge drinkers' profiles, we ran a cluster analysis to characterize the alcohol users at higher risk of more severe neuropsychological impairment. Results: Overall, poorer neuropsychological performances were observed among binge drinkers compared with light drinkers, whether they used cannabis or not. However, flexibility, episodic memory and working memory were particularly affected among binge drinkers who used cannabis. Conclusions: Results emphasize the importance of asking binge drinkers if they smoke cannabis, in order to adapt care and prevention strategies to their consumption and neuropsychological profile. \",\n\"Why should we ask binge drinkers if they smoke cannabis?

A Survey of Fourth-Year Medical Students\",\n\"Purpose: The number of US fourth-year medical students applying to radiation oncology has decreased during the past few years. We conducted a survey of fourth-year medical students to examine factors that may be influencing the decision to pursue radiation oncology. Methods and Materials: An anonymous online survey was sent to medical students at 9 participating US medical schools. Results: A total of 232 medical students completed the survey. Of the 153 students who stated they were never interested in radiation oncology, 77 (50%) reported never having been exposed to the specialty as their reason for not pursuing radiation oncology. The job market was the most commonly cited factor among students who said they were once interested in but ultimately chose not to pursue radiation oncology. Conversely, the recent low pass rates for board examinations and a perception of a lack of diversity within radiation oncology had the least influence. Conclusions: Despite discussion of potential measures to address this disquieting trend, there have been minimal formal attempts to characterize and address potential causes of a decreasing interest in radiation oncology. This study's data are consistent with previous research regarding the trend of decreased medical student interest in radiation oncology and may be used as part of ongoing introspective assessment to inform future change within radiation oncology. \",\n\"Why an Increasing Number of Unmatched Residency Positions in Radiation Oncology?

All CF patients were >12-years of age, had chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection and at least one positive sputum culture in the prior 12-months. The majority of patients were studied during clinical stability, however, four patients were studied close to the completion of intravenous antibiotics for logistic reasons (e.g. travelling long distance, avoid missing school attendance). Healthy control participants were recruited from contact with staff at both healthcare facilities including relatives of the staff for the younger controls. Nineteen CF patients with CF and 10 healthy controls participated. Two patients and two controls performed only one of the experiment days. The Distance Rig consisted of an expandable wind tunnel that allowed high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA)-filtered air to be introduced upstream of the subject;[1] ensuring unidirectional air flow of particle-free air and permitting measurement of cough aerosols at distances of 0 to 4-metres from the subject without interference from other particle sources ( Figure E1 ). The air velocity was maintained at 0.1-metres/sec, typical of a mechanicallyventilated indoor environment, such as a hospital.[2-4] The Rig was positively pressurized to prevent room air contamination. A six-stage Andersen Impactor (Thermo Scientific, Franklin, MA) captured and sized viable cough aerosols in the six stages between 0.6 and >7 \\uf06dm. [5] A vacuum pump was used to draw 28.3 L/min of air through the Impactor. The pump flow was checked daily using a rotameter, and all Andersen Impactor O-rings were inspected for wear. Exhaust air from the pump was HEPA-filtered. A Lasair II-110 (Particle Measuring Systems, Boulder, CO) optical particle counter (OPC) measured real-time particle concentration in six channels between 0.1 and >5 \\u00b5m using a sample flow of 28.3 L/min, permitting detection of very low concentrations. The OPC verified that there were no room air particles present before each test, subjects' lungs were free of residual room air, and no contamination of aerosols occurred during testing. It also confirmed that the total particle concentration in the Rig was <0.01 particles per cm 3 (p/cc) prior to the subject coughing, which was approximately 10 4 times lower than the room air concentration and similar to an ISO 4 cleanroom. The Andersen Impactor and OPC samples were collected through a common 12.5 cm circular, sharp-edged isokinetic inlet. It was set parallel to the airflow and provided 100% particle aspiration efficiency at the tunnel air velocity of 0.1 metres/sec. [6] Smoke visualization tests confirmed sample extraction by the inlet was uniform. One metre of conductive tubing transported samples from the inlet to the Andersen Impactor and OPC. The tubing residence time was 1-sec for Andersen samples and 0.06-sec for OPC samples. Sample losses due to gravitational settling and inertial impaction were from 0 to 8% and 0 to 1%, respectively, and diffusion losses were negligible.[6] Air velocity was monitored continuously using a 9535 hot-wire anemometer (TSI Inc., St. Paul, MN).

End organ damage to heart is one of the most severe complications of COVID-19 that increases the risk of death. We proposed a two-fold mechanism responsible for causing acute coronary events in patients with COVID-19 infection: Cytokine storm leading to rapid onset formation of new coronary plaques along with destabilization of pre-existing plaques and direct myocardial injury secondary to acute systemic viral infection. A well-coordinated immune response is the first line innate immunity against a viral infection. However, an uncoordinated response and hypersecretion of cytokines and chemokines lead to immune related damage to the human body. Human Coronavirus (HCoV) infection causes infiltration of inflammatory cells that cause excessive production of cytokines, proteases, coagulation factors, oxygen radicals and vasoactive molecules causing endothelial damage, disruption of fibrous cap and initiation of formation of thrombus.

The resultant cytokine storm causes secretion of hypercoagulable tissue factor without consequential increase in counter-regulatory pathways such as AT-III, activated protein C and plasminogen activator type 1. Lastly, influx of CD4+ T-cells in cardiac vasculature results in an increased production of cytokines that stimulate smooth muscle cells to migrate into the intima and generate 3 collagen and other fibrous products leading to advancement of fatty streaks to advanced atherosclerotic lesions.

The travel behavior and operations will not be the same as before due to requirements such as physical (social) distancing. This study analyzes the resulting shortage in supply of public transport (buses) that will likely widen the existing gap between demand and supply. In this work, system optimization models are developed to efficiently reallocate the bus fleet to routes for different levels of physical distancing gaps and travel demand. The proposed models are applied to a real-life network of 34 bus routes of Delhi, considering three types of scenarios: current, practical, and ideal. In the practical scenarios, the additional, idling bus fleets can be allocated to the routes efficiently while maintaining physical distancing. The results show that the Business-as-Usual (BAU) scenario involving the current allocation approach will make it impossible to use public buses even if the bare minimum physical distancing has to be maintained. Further, the models proposed in the study significantly improve the key performance indicators for all scenarios.

Importantly, provider stress is also connected to patient care, with recent research on Canada's opioid crisis finding that compassion satisfaction and burnout are linked to the perpetuation of negative attitudes and behaviours towards people with opioid use problems. In 2017, the Fraser Health Authority developed a training program for direct service providers designed to address this important connection-a mental health and resiliency program based in the principles of trauma-informed practice and care. This article reports the results of an evaluation of this program. Findings suggest that embedding resiliency and self-compassion within trauma-informed training programs is a promising approach for cultural change in healthcare practice.

The objectives of this study were to determine the early and dynamic alterations of Th1 and Th2 populations to community-acquired severe sepsis upon onset among previously immunocompetent patients and whether it was related to clinical outcomes. Methods: This prospective observational cohort study was conducted at a general intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary teaching hospital in China. Immunocompetent patients with community-acquired severe sepsis within 24 h upon onset were included as septic group. Healthy volunteers and critically ill patients without severe sepsis were recruited as controls. Whole blood was collected on D0, 3rd day (D3) and 7th day (D7) for septic group and once upon enrollment for controls. Th1 and Th2 populations were measured by flow cytometry and assessed for associations with 28-day mortality using cox proportional hazard models. Associations of dynamic alterations of Th cell subpopulations with clinical outcomes were investigated. This study demonstrated that community-acquired severe sepsis patients (n = 71) had increased Th2/Th1 and Th2 populations, compared to healthy controls (n = 7) and critically ill patients without severe sepsis (n = 7) at admission. Among the septic cohort, values of Th2/Th1 were significantly higher in non-survivors than survivors on D0 (p = 0.04), D3 (p < 0.001) and D7 (p < 0.001). Patients with persistently increasing Th2/Th1 demonstrated the highest mortality (47.1%) and incidence of ICU-acquired infections (64.7%). Conclusions: Th2/Th1 was markedly up-regulated with Th2 dominance upon community-acquired severe sepsis onset among previously immunocompetent patients and its persistently dynamic increase was associated with ICUacquired infections and 28-day death. \",\n\"Early and dynamic alterations of Th2/Th1 in previously immunocompetent patients with community-acquired severe sepsis: a prospective observational study[SEP]Background: T helper (Th) cells regulate sepsis processes, including primary pathogen clear and secondary pathogen defence.

Optimal portfolio weights are found by solving a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) partial differential equation, which we solve for both an unconstrained portfolio and a portfolio constrained to be market neutral. Our analyses demonstrate sufficient conditions on the model parameters to ensure long-term stability of the HJB solutions and stable growth rates for the optimal portfolios. To gauge how these optimal portfolios behave in practice, we perform backtests on historical stock prices of the S&P 500 constituents from year 2000 through year 2021. These backtests suggest three key conclusions: that the proposed co-integrated model with eigenportfolios being factors can generate a large number of co-integrated stocks over a long time horizon, that the optimal portfolios are sensitive to parameter estimation, and that the statistical arbitrage strategies are more profitable in periods when overall market volatilities are high. \",\n\"Statistical Arbitrage for Multiple Co-Integrated Stocks[SEP]In this article, we analyse optimal statistical arbitrage strategies from stochastic control and optimisation problems for multiple co-integrated stocks with eigenportfolios being factors.

In this paper we describe South African FSWs' exposure to violence and factors associated with having been raped in the past year. Methods: We conducted a multi-stage, community-centric, cross-sectional survey of 3005 FSWs linked to sex worker programmes in 12 sites across all nine provinces that had a SW programme. Adult women who sold sex in the preceding six months were recruited for interviews via sex worker networks. Survey tools were developed in consultation with peer educators and FSWs. Results: In the past year, 70.4% of FSWs experienced physical violence and 57.9% were raped: by policemen (14.0%), clients (48.3%), other men (30.2%) and/or and intimate partner (31.9%). Sexual IPV was associated with food insecurity, entering sex work as a child, childhood trauma exposure, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), drinking alcohol to cope with sex work, working more days, partner controlling behaviour, having an exclient partner, and having no current partner to protect from ex-partners. Rape by a client, other men or policemen was associated with food insecurity, childhood trauma, PTSD, depression, using alcohol and drugs, being homeless or staying in a sex work venue, selling sex on the streets, working more days and having entered sex work as a child and been in sex work for longer. Conclusion: South African FSWs are very vulnerable to rape. Within the social climate of gender inequality, sex work stigma, criminalisation, and repeated victimisation, the key drivers are structural factors, childhood and other trauma exposure, mental ill-health, circumstances of sex work and, for SIPV, partner characteristics. Mostly these are amenable to intervention, with legislative change being foundational for ending abuse by policemen, enhancing safety of indoor venues and providing greater economic options for women. \",\n\"Sexual IPV and non-partner rape of female sex workers: Findings of a cross-sectional community-centric national study in South Africa[SEP]Background: Globally female sex workers (FSWs) are vulnerable to violence from intimate partners, police and clients due to stigma and criminalisation.

There is, however, no consensus on the origin of this pattern, which may originate from human behaviour rather than from the virus diffusion itself. Time-honoured models of the SIR type 2 or others based on complex networks 3-5 describe well the exponential spread of the disease, but cannot naturally accommodate the wave pattern. Nevertheless, understanding this time-structure is of paramount importance in designing effective prevention measures. Here we propose a consistent picture of the wave pattern based on the epidemic Renormalisation Group (eRG) framework 6, 7 , which is guided by the global symmetries of the system under time rescaling. We show that the rate of spreading of the disease can be interpreted as a time-dilation symmetry, while the final stage of an epidemic episode corresponds to reaching a time scale-invariant state. We find that the endemic period between two waves is a sign of instability in the system, associated to near-breaking of the time scale-invariance. This phenomenon can be described in terms of an eRG model featuring complex fixed points 8 . Our results demonstrate that the key to control the arrival of the next wave of a pandemic is in the strolling period in between waves, i.e. when the number of infections grow linearly. Thus, limiting the virus diffusion in this period is the most effective way to prevent or delay the arrival of the next wave. In this work we establish a new guiding principle for the formulation of mid-term governmental strategies to curb pandemics and avoid recurrent waves of infections, deleterious in terms of human life loss and economic damage. As it emerged from the Spanish Influenza that hit the World in three consecutive waves between spring 1918 and the early months of 1919, virus-driven pandemics can feature a wave pattern, even though the origin of this behaviour is not understood 1 . The very recent pandemic, caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, is showing a similar pattern, with a first wave hitting in the spring of 2020, and following ones still raging various regions of the World. Reliable algorithms were used at the beginning of the pandemic to predict the evolution of the number of cases affected by the COVID-19 disease 9-11 , however it has proven difficult to predict the arrival of a second wave in the fall 2020 12 . With the exception of a few countries like China, Vietnam and New Zealand, all regions of the World are suffering from multiple waves of COVID-19 infections. The diffusion of the virus can be described by various time-honoured models, like compartmental models of the SIR type 2 and complex networks 3-5 . These mathematical frameworks account for the exponential growth of the number of new infected cases, and the slowing down of the spreading once most of the susceptible cases are infected. However, it is not a simple task to generate a wave pattern. For instance, in SIR models, one could induce a second wave either by injecting by hand new individuals in the susceptible sub-population, or by including a probability that the removed individuals may return to the state of susceptible. The latter case cannot apply to the COVID-19, as very few cases of recovered individuals being infected again have been recorded. In an article first posted at the beginning of August 13 , we successfully predicted the occurrence of a second wave in Europe starting in September-October.

Purpose Frailty may be associated with higher fracture risk, but limited research has been carried out using a multidimensional approach to frailty assessment and diagnosis. The present research aimed to investigate whether the MPI, based on comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA), is associated with the risk of fractures in the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) study. Methods Community-dwellers affected by knee OA or at high risk for this condition were followed-up for 8 years. A standardized CGA including information on functional, nutritional, mood, comorbidity, medication, quality of life, and cohabitation status was used to calculate the MPI. Fractures were diagnosed using self-reported information. Cox's regression analysis was carried out and results are reported as hazard ratios (HRs), with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusted for potential confounders. Results The sample consisted of 4024 individuals (mean age 61.0 years, females = 59.0%). People with incident fractures had a significant higher MPI baseline value than those without (0.42 \\u00b1 0.18 vs. 0.40 \\u00b1 0.17). After adjusting for several potential confounders, people with an MPI over 0.66 (HR = 1.49; 95%CI: 1.11-2.00) experienced a higher risk of fractures. An increase in 0.10 point in MPI score corresponded to an increase in fracture risk of 4% (HR = 1.04; 95%CI: 1.008-1.07). Higher MPI values were also associated with a higher risk of non-vertebral clinical fractures. Conclusion Higher MPI values at baseline were associated with an increased risk of fractures, reinforcing the importance of CGA in predicting fractures in older people affected by knee OA. \",\n\"Multidimensional prognostic index and the risk of fractures: an 8-year longitudinal cohort study in the Osteoarthritis Initiative[SEP]In this longitudinal study, with a follow-up of 8 years, multidimensional prognostic index (MPI), a product of the comprehensive geriatric assessment, significantly predicted the onset of fractures in older people affected by knee osteoarthritis. Purpose Frailty may be associated with higher fracture risk, but limited research has been carried out using a multidimensional approach to frailty assessment and diagnosis. The present research aimed to investigate whether the MPI, based on comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA), is associated with the risk of fractures in the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) study. Methods Community-dwellers affected by knee OA or at high risk for this condition were followed-up for 8 years. A standardized CGA including information on functional, nutritional, mood, comorbidity, medication, quality of life, and cohabitation status was used to calculate the MPI. Fractures were diagnosed using self-reported information. Cox's regression analysis was carried out and results are reported as hazard ratios (HRs), with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusted for potential confounders. Results The sample consisted of 4024 individuals (mean age 61.0 years, females = 59.0%). People with incident fractures had a significant higher MPI baseline value than those without (0.42 \\u00b1 0.18 vs. 0.40 \\u00b1 0.17). After adjusting for several potential confounders, people with an MPI over 0.66 (HR = 1.49; 95%CI: 1.11-2.00) experienced a higher risk of fractures. An increase in 0.10 point in MPI score corresponded to an increase in fracture risk of 4% (HR = 1.04; 95%CI: 1.008-1.07). Higher MPI values were also associated with a higher risk of non-vertebral clinical fractures. Conclusion Higher MPI values at baseline were associated with an increased risk of fractures, reinforcing the importance of CGA in predicting fractures in older people affected by knee OA. \"],\n [\"The impacts of a COVID-19 epidemic focus and general belief in a just world on individual emotions The Impacts of a COVID-19 Epidemic Focus and General Belief in a Just World on Individual Emotions 1 The Impacts of a COVID-19 Epidemic Focus and General Belief in a Just World on Individual Emotions\",\n\"Whether the general belief in a just world (GBJW) can protect individual emotions during a major disaster is a matter of debate. This study conducted two experiments to explore this question during the COVID-19 epidemic. Experiment 1 (N = 92, M age = 22.52, 48.91% was male) manipulated the focus regarding the COVID-19 epidemic to investigate the impact of this focus on participants' emotions.

The results showed that high levels of GBJW reduced negative emotions and increased positive emotions regardless of whether the participants were focused on the epidemic. This study expands the influence of the GBJW on individual emotions and finds that the GBJW can protect individuals' emotions when they face a major social disaster. These findings imply that controlling people's intake of information on the epidemic can avoid their suffering from the vicarious traumatization caused by epidemic-related information overload and that improving the public's GBJW protects their mental health during an epidemic. \",\n\"The impacts of a COVID-19 epidemic focus and general belief in a just world on individual emotions The Impacts of a COVID-19 Epidemic Focus and General Belief in a Just World on Individual Emotions 1 The Impacts of a COVID-19 Epidemic Focus and General Belief in a Just World on Individual Emotions[SEP]Whether the general belief in a just world (GBJW) can protect individual emotions during a major disaster is a matter of debate.

Here, using structure-32 guided approaches, we developed divalent ACE2 molecules by grafting the extracellular ACE2-33 domain onto a human IgG1 or IgG3 (ACE2-Fc). These ACE2-Fcs harbor structurally validated 34 mutations that enhance spike (S) binding and remove angiotensin enzymatic activity. The lead 35 variant bound tightly to S, mediated in vitro neutralization of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern 36 (VOCs) with sub-nanomolar IC50 and was capable of robust Fc-effector functions, including 37 antibody-dependent-cellular cytotoxicity, phagocytosis and complement deposition. When tested 38 in a stringent K18-hACE2 mouse model, it delayed death or effectively resolved lethal SARS-39 CoV-2 infection in a prophylactic or therapeutic setting utilizing the combined effect of 40 neutralization and Fc-effector functions. These data confirm the utility of ACE2-Fcs as valuable 41 agents in preventing and eliminating SARS-CoV-2 infection and demonstrate that ACE2-Fc 42 therapeutic activity require Fc-effector functions. : bioRxiv preprint 44 Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a betacoronavirus closely 45 related to SARS-CoV-1, is the ninth documented coronavirus capable of infecting humans (1, 2) 46 and has led to a devastating on-going pandemic, resulting in nearly 5 million deaths (3) worldwide 47 since it first emerged in the Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019. This highly transmissible airborne 48 pathogen is an enveloped virus with a large, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome. Since 49 the genetic sequence became available in January 2020, the development of both traditional 50 vaccines (e.g. inactivated virus, recombinant proteins, viral vectors etc.) and novel RNA/DNA 51 strategies has moved at an unprecedented pace (4). The world-wide emergency rollout of vaccines 52 clearly aided in the suppression of viral circulation and reduced the risk of severe illnesses; 53 however, continuous viral evolution and the resulting variants of concern (VOCs) have the 54 potential to circumvent immunity conferred by both natural infection and vaccination. In 55 preparation for the inevitable SARS-CoV-2 VOCs and any future potential pandemic or zoonotic 56 spillovers, it is important that additional interventions and therapies effective against the vast 57 natural CoV reservoirs are developed and stockpiled. 58 59 A major antigenic site on the SARS-CoV-2 virion surface is the spike trimer (S) which mediates 60 viral-host membrane fusion and subsequent entry via the primary host cell receptor angiotensin-61 converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (5-8). Viral entry is initiated by specific interaction of the S1 subunit 62 receptor binding domain (RBD) to ACE2, followed by S2-directed membrane fusion (9-11). Most 63 neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) elicited through natural infection and vaccination act by disrupting 64 this interaction; however, selection pressure results in viral escape mutations, in many cases 65 generating VOCs with an enhanced ability to bind host receptors (12-16). : bioRxiv preprint 67 Full-length ACE2 consists of an N-terminal protease domain (PD, residue 18-615) which directly 68 engages SARS-CoV-2 RBD, a collectrin-like domain (CLD, residue 616-740), a single 69 transmembrane helix (residue 741-765) and a ~40 amino-acid intracellular C-terminal domain 70 (17). ACE2 is an essential zinc-dependent carboxypeptidase and critical regulator of the renin-71 angiotensin system (RAS). ACE2 PD converts Angiotensin (Ang) II to Ang 1-7, relieving the 72 vasoconstriction, inflammation and oxidative stress effect of Ang II (18, 19) . 73 Membrane bound ACE2 is naturally shed from cell membranes and the circulating ACE2 was 75 reported to play a protective role from SARS-CoV-2 infection in women and children (20). 76 Recombinant soluble ACE2 decoys were therefore proposed and tested as potential SARS-CoV-2 77 therapies since the early onset of the COVID19 pandemic (21-23). A pilot clinical trial of human 78 recombinant soluble ACE2 (hrsACE2) administered intravenously (0.4 mg/kg) in a severely 79 SARS-CoV-2 infected patient showed rapid viral clearance in sera, followed by nasal cavity and 80 lung clearance at a later time (24). Concomitant with the viral load reduction was a profound 81 decrease of Ang II and a proportional increase of the ACE2 products Ang 1-7 and 1-9 in the 82 plasma. Although ACE2 activity is thought to protect from cardiovascular disorders, an ACE2 83 inactivated mutant, which has demonstrated equivalent binding to SARS-CoV-2 RBD (25, 26), 84 offers a potentially safer therapeutic option applicable to wider cohorts without disturbing the RAS 85 balance. 86 Since monomeric ACE2 binds to SARS-CoV-2 RBD with only moderate affinity (KD ~20-30 nM), 88 engineered ACE2 derivatives with improved affinity to SARS-CoV-2 were developed as antiviral 89 : bioRxiv preprint therapeutics by several approaches, including deep-mutagenesis coupled with flow-cytometry-90 based screening (27-29), computation-aided design and yeast display (25, 30), multimerization of 91 ACE2 (23, 26,(31)(32)(33)(34), de novo design of ACE2-derived miniprotein and peptides (35) and ACE2 92 decorated vesicles (36). Recently, the bivalent ACE2-Fc (i.e. ACE2 extracellular domain grafted 93 onto an IgG1 backbone) molecules have gained considerable attention as they are able to bind 94 SARS-CoV-2 S with increased affinity (mostly through increased avidity) and potently neutralize 95 VOCs, including those resistant to common nAbs (28, 29). As most currently investigated ACE2-96 Fc based therapeutic approaches focus on neutralizing activities, the potential of ACE2-Fcs as 97 agents capable of Fc-mediated effector functions, including antibody dependent cellular 98 cytotoxicity (ADCC), cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) and complement deposition (ADCD) is 99 largely unknown and has not been tested in vitro or in vivo in models of SARS-CoV-2 infection. 100 Here we employed a structure-guided approach to develop a series of ACE2-Fc variants, using a 102 human IgG1 or IgG3 backbone. Our variants were engineered to have 1) significantly increased 103 affinity to SARS-CoV-2 RBD derived from the Wuhan strain, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351, 2) enhanced 104 affinity for Fc\\uf067 receptors involved in Fc-effector mechanisms and 3) mutations to abrogate the 105 angiotensin enzymatic activity of ACE2.

Those patients who receive orders for pharmacologic prophylaxis with low-dose low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or minidose unfractionated heparin rarely develop major in-hospital deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE). (This is not the case for hospitalized patients with coronavirus disease-2019 [COVID-19], who routinely develop DVT or PE, despite the administration of conventional low-dose anticoagulation. However, this is not the topic of this editorial.) General and orthopedic surgeons took the lead in developing the concept of in-hospital VTE prophylaxis. Their idea was counterintuitive and initially controversial. Give patients a low dose of injected LMWH or heparin before the surgical incision, and continue prophylaxis for at least 1 week. Fortunately, the benefits of decreased PE and DVT outweighed the risk of major bleeding. In 1986, a decade after the first landmark VTE prophylaxis trial (1), in-hospital VTE prophylaxis for both surgical and medical patients received widespread consensus approval and endorsement at a large consensus conference convened by the National Institutes of Health (2). The clock moved slowly. It took 11 years to garner the credibility of this approach across the health care community. When surgeons realized that some of their patients who had \\\"perfect\\\" operations had DVT or died of PE within weeks after hospital discharge, they undertook trials of extended-duration VTE prophylaxis after hospital discharge. Patients undergoing major cancer surgery, total hip replacement, and total knee replacement benefited from VTE prophylaxis for approximately 1 month following discharge. Of great importance is that the surgical community rapidly adopted extended-duration VTE prophylaxis as the norm, not the exception. This has not been the case with medical patients. The narrative is different for medical patients discharged with common diagnoses such as heart failure, pneumonia, or chronic obstructive lung disease. Two anticoagulant drugs have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for extended-duration VTE prophylaxis: betrixaban, in 2017; and rivaroxaban, in 2019. Most health care providers are not familiar with betrixaban, an anti-Xa agent that received FDA approval after the landmark APEX (Acute Medically Ill VTE Prevention With Extended Duration Betrixaban) trial (3).

Group-testing strategies have been proposed to increase capacity, but these have been designed to facilitate mass population testing and do not prioritize turnaround time, an important consideration for HCW screening. We propose a non-adaptive combinatorial (NAC) group-testing strategy to increase throughput whilst facilitating rapid turnaround. NAC matrices were constructed for sample sizes of 700, 350 and 250. Matrix performance was tested by simulation under different SARS-CoV-2 prevalence scenarios of 0.1-10%. NAC matrices were compared to Dorfman Sequential (DS) group-testing approaches. NAC matrices performed well at low prevalence levels with an average of 97% of samples resolved after a single round of testing via the n=700 matrix at a prevalence of 1%. In simulations of low to medium (0.1%-3%) prevalence all NAC matrices were superior to the DS strategy, measured by fewer repeated tests required. At very high prevalence levels (10%) the DS matrix was marginally superior, however both group-testing approaches performed poorly at high prevalence levels. This strategy maximises the proportion of samples resolved after a single round of testing, allowing prompt return of results to HCWs. Using this methodology, laboratories can adapt their testing scheme based on required throughput and the current population prevalence, facilitating a data-driven testing strategy.

Feminist activists played a leading role in shaping a new Scottish Parliament in the 1980s and 1990s, which has influenced the politics of devolution since 1999. This article appraises this experience using a combination of feminist texts drawn from across the time period as well as autobiographies and biographies of prominent Scottish female politicians. The findings demonstrate that Scottish feminine political leadership has been strongly moulded by a rejection of Westminster's archaic and conflictual politics, which are understood to be masculine. Feminists' experiences of organising in the Women's Liberation Movement pointed to the importance of institution building and pragmatically working towards shared goals across traditional divisions. Scottish feminists' emphasis on consensus decision making and achieving objectives across party lines, especially on subjects gender-coded as women's issues, has moulded a centre-left framing for Scottish women's leadership that rejects both conservatism and left-wing radicalism. The achievement of aspirations surrounding increased women's representation and leadership has perhaps come at the cost of the larger earlier ambitions for a more inclusive parliament accountable to the Women's Liberation Movement and working-class communities.

Due to inequalities from residential segregation, Hispanic and Black populations have challenges in meeting health expectations. However, segregated neighborhoods also support the formation of social bonds that relate to healthy behaviors. We evaluate the question of non-White distancing using social mobility data from Google on three sites: workplaces, grocery stores, and recreational locations. Employing hierarchical linear modeling and geographically weighted regression, we find the relation of race/ethnicity to COVID-19 distancing is varied across the United States. The HLM models show that compared to Black populations, Hispanic populations overall more effectively distance from recreation sites and grocery stores: each point increase in percent Hispanic was related to residents being 0.092 percent less likely (p< 0.05) to visit recreational sites and 0.127 percent less likely (p< 0.01) to visit grocery stores since the onset of COVID-19. However, the GWR models show there are places where the percent Black is locally related to recreation distancing while percent Hispanic is not. Further, these models show the association of percent Black to recreation and grocery distancing can be locally as strong as 1.057 percent (p< 0.05) and 0.989 percent (p< 0.05), respectively. Next, the HLM models identified that Black/White residential isolation was related to less distancing, with each point of isolation residents were 11.476 percent more likely (p< 0.01) to go to recreational sites and 7.493 percent more likely (p< 0.05) to visit grocery stores compared to before COVID-19.

With limited medical resources, the treatment priority is determined by the severity of patients. However, many mild outpatients quickly deteriorate into severe/critical stage. It is crucial to early identify them and give timely treatment for optimizing treatment strategy and reducing mortality. This study aims to establish an AI model to predict mild patients with potential malignant progression. Methods: A total of 133 consecutively mild COVID-19 patients at admission who was hospitalized in Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital from January 3 to February 13, 2020, were selected in this retrospective IRB-approved study. All mild patients were categorized into groups with or without malignant progression. The clinical and laboratory data at admission, the first CT, and the follow-up CT at the severe/critical stage of the two groups were compared. Both multivariate logistic regression and deep learning-based methods were used to build the prediction models, with their area under ROC curves (AUC) compared. : Multivariate logistic regression depicted 6 risk factors for malignant progression: age >55years (OR 5.334, 95%CI 1.8-15.803), comorbid with hypertension (OR 5.093, 95%CI 1.236-20.986), a decrease of albumin (OR 4.01, 95%CI 1.216-13.223), a decrease of lymphocyte (OR 3.459, 95%CI 1.067-11.209), the progressive consolidation from CT1 to CTsevere (OR 1.235, 95%CI 1.018-1.498), and elevated HCRP (OR 1.015, 95%CI 1.002-1.029); and one protective factor: the presence of fibrosis at CT1 (OR 0.656, 95%CI 0.473-0.91).

Methods: We set up a transmission model, and the model parameters are estimated from the survey data via Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. The Bayesian data augmentation approaches are used to account for uncertainty in the source of infection, unobserved onset, and infection dates. Results: The rate of transmission of COVID-19 within households is 9.2 %. Older people are more susceptible to infection. The accuracy of our reconstructed transmission chain was 67.26%. In the gathering place of this outbreak, the Beef and Mutton Trading Hall of Xinfadi market, most of the transmission occurs within 20m, only 19.61% of the transmission occurs over a wider area (>20m), with an overall average transmission distance of 13.00m.

BCV propagation was significantly inhibited by pretreatment of the virus with EGCg (0.5-10 \\u03bcg/mL) before virus inoculation in dose-dependent, incubation time-dependent and temperature-dependent manners. The antiviral effect of pretreating MDBK cells with EGCg on BCV propagation was much weaker than that of pretreating BCV with EGCg. The hemagglutination activity of BCV was also reduced by EGCg in a dose-dependent manner. These results demonstrate that EGCg possesses a distinct anti-BCV activity and strongly suggest that EGCg interferes with the adsorption of BCV to MDBK cells by the interaction of EGCg with BCV particles. EGCg may therefore be a useful candidate for controlling BCV infection more effectively. \",\n\"507 O R I G I N A L A R T I C L E Inhibitory effects of epigallocatechin gallate on the propagation of bovine coronavirus in Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells[SEP]Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCg) is the main active component of tea polyphenol and shows several biological activities, such as antimicrobial, antitumor-promoting, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative activities.

Dapagliflozin, a SGLT2 inhibitor, has significant protective benefits for the heart and kidney. We aimed to see whether this agent might provide organ protection in patients with COVID-19 by affecting processes dysregulated during acute illness. Methods DARE-19 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of patients hospitalised with COVID-19 and with at least one cardiometabolic risk factor (ie, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease). Patients critically ill at screening were excluded. Patients were randomly assigned 1:1 to dapagliflozin (10 mg daily orally) or matched placebo for 30 days. Dual primary outcomes were assessed in the intention-to-treat population: the outcome of prevention (time to new or worsened organ dysfunction or death), and the hierarchial composite outcome of recovery (change in clinical status by day 30). Safety outcomes, in patients who received at least one study medication dose, included serious adverse events, adverse events leading to discontinuation, and adverse events of interest. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04350593. Findings Between April 22, 2020 and Jan 1, 2021, 1250 patients were randomly assigned with 625 in each group. The primary composite outcome of prevention showed organ dysfunction or death occurred in 70 patients (11\\u00b72%) in the dapagliflozin group, and 86 (13\\u00b78%) in the placebo group (hazard ratio [HR] 0\\u00b780, 95% CI 0\\u00b758-1\\u00b710; p=0\\u00b717). For the primary outcome of recovery, 547 patients (87\\u00b75%) in the dapagliflozin group and 532 (85\\u00b71%) in the placebo group showed clinical status improvement, although this was not statistically significant (win ratio 1\\u00b709, 95% CI 0\\u00b797-1\\u00b722; p=0\\u00b714). There were 41 deaths (6\\u00b76%) in the dapagliflozin group, and 54 (8\\u00b76%) in the placebo group (HR 0\\u00b777, 95% CI 0\\u00b752-1\\u00b716). Serious adverse events were reported in 65 (10\\u00b76%) of 613 patients treated with dapagliflozin and in 82 (13\\u00b73%) of 616 patients given the placebo. Interpretation In patients with cardiometabolic risk factors who were hospitalised with COVID-19, treatment with dapagliflozin did not result in a statistically significant risk reduction in organ dysfunction or death, or improvement in clinical recovery, but was well tolerated.

In Yemen, however, its epidemiology is unknown. Therefore, this study determined its prevalence and predictors among HIV/AIDS patients receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Sana'a city, the capital of Yemen. This cross-sectional study included 402 patients receiving ART at Al-Jomhori Educational Hospital in Sana'a from November 2019 to December 2020. Data about demographics, clinical characteristics and risk factors were collected using a pre-designed questionnaire. Stool samples were collected and examined for microsporidian spores using the Gram-chromotrope Kinyoun staining. Blood samples were also collected and used for CD4 cell counting by flow cytometry. Univariate analysis was used to test the association of patients' characteristics and risk factors with intestinal microsporidiosis. Multivariable logistic regression was then used to identify the independent predictors of infection. Statistical significance was considered at P-values < 0.05. Intestinal microsporidiosis was prevalent among 14.2% (57/402) of HIV/AIDS patients and was significantly associated with diarrhea (OR 3.4, 95% CI 1.7-6.6; P = 0.001).

In Yemen, however, its epidemiology is unknown. Therefore, this study determined its prevalence and predictors among HIV/AIDS patients receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Sana'a city, the capital of Yemen. This cross-sectional study included 402 patients receiving ART at Al-Jomhori Educational Hospital in Sana'a from November 2019 to December 2020. Data about demographics, clinical characteristics and risk factors were collected using a pre-designed questionnaire. Stool samples were collected and examined for microsporidian spores using the Gram-chromotrope Kinyoun staining. Blood samples were also collected and used for CD4 cell counting by flow cytometry. Univariate analysis was used to test the association of patients' characteristics and risk factors with intestinal microsporidiosis. Multivariable logistic regression was then used to identify the independent predictors of infection. Statistical significance was considered at P-values < 0.05. Intestinal microsporidiosis was prevalent among 14.2% (57/402) of HIV/AIDS patients and was significantly associated with diarrhea (OR 3.4, 95% CI 1.7-6.6; P = 0.001).

We conducted this study to show the different spectral frequency and time domain parameters of HRV as a prospective predictor for critically ill patients, and in particular for COVID-19 patients who are on mechanical ventilation. The hypothesis is that most severely ill COVID-19 patients have a depletion of the sympathetic nervous system and a predominance of parasympathetic activity reflecting the remaining compensatory anti-inflammatory response.

We employed a mammalian two-hybrid system to screen all the viral proteins of SARS-CoV-2 for the protein-protein interactions. Our study detected 48 interactions, 14 of which were firstly reported here. Unlike Nsp1 of SARS-CoV, Nsp1 of SARS-CoV-2 has the most interacting partners among all the viral proteins and likely functions as a hub for the viral proteins. Five self-interactions were confirmed, and five interactions, Nsp1/Nsp3.1, Nsp3.1/N, Nsp3.2/Nsp12, Nsp10/ Nsp14, and Nsp10/Nsp16, were determined to be positive bidirectionally. Using the replicon reporter system of SARS-CoV-2, we screened all viral Nsps for their impacts on the viral replication and revealed Nsp3.1, the N-terminus of Nsp3, significantly inhibited the replicon reporter gene expression. We found Nsp3 interacted with N through its acidic region at N-terminus, while N interacted with Nsp3 through its NTD, which is rich in the basic amino acids. Furthermore, using purified truncated N and Nsp3 proteins, we determined the direct interactions between Nsp3 and N protein. Our findings provided a basis for understanding the functions of coronavirus proteins and supported the potential of interactions as the target for antiviral drug development. \",\n\"Genome-wide analysis of protein-protein interactions and involvement of viral proteins in SARS-CoV-2 replication[SEP]Background: Analysis of viral protein-protein interactions is an essential step to uncover the viral protein functions and the molecular mechanism for the assembly of a viral protein complex.

The continuous NBDC data can partially reflect individuals' behaviors and status, such as social connections and interactions, working status, mobility, and social isolation and loneliness, which were found to be significantly associated with depression by previous survey-based studies. Objective: This paper aims to explore the NBDC data's value in predicting depressive symptom severity as measured via the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8). The data used in this paper included 2,886 bi-weekly PHQ-8 records collected from 316 participants recruited from three study sites in the Netherlands, Spain, and the UK as part of the EU RADAR-CNS study. From the NBDC data two weeks prior to each PHQ-8 score, we extracted 49 Bluetooth features, including statistical features and nonlinear features for measuring periodicity and regularity of individuals' life rhythms. Linear mixed-effect models were used to explore associations between Bluetooth features and the PHQ-8 score. We then applied hierarchical Bayesian linear regression models to predict the PHQ-8 score from the extracted Bluetooth features. Result: A number of significant associations were found between Bluetooth features and depressive symptom severity. Generally speaking, along with the depressive symptoms worsening, one or more of the following changes were found in the preceding two weeks' NBDC data: (1) the amount decreased, (2) the variance decreased, (3) the periodicity (especially circadian rhythm) decreased, and (4) the NBDC sequence became more irregular. Compared with commonly used machine learning models, the proposed hierarchical Bayesian linear regression model achieved the best prediction metrics, 2 = 0.526, and root mean squared error (RMSE) of 3.891. Bluetooth features can explain an extra 18.8% of the variance in the PHQ-8 score relative to the baseline model without Bluetooth features ( 2 =0.338, RMSE = 4.547). Our statistical results indicate that the NBDC data has the potential to reflect changes in individuals' behaviors and status concurrent with the changes in the depressive state. The prediction results demonstrate the NBDC data has a significant value in predicting depressive symptom severity. These findings may have utility for mental health monitoring practice in real-world settings. \",\n\"Title: Predicting Depressive Symptom Severity through Individuals' Nearby Bluetooth Devices Count Data Collected by Mobile Phones: A Preliminary Longitudinal Study[SEP]The Bluetooth sensor embedded in mobile phones provides an unobtrusive, continuous, and cost-efficient means to capture individuals' proximity information, such as the nearby Bluetooth devices count (NBDC).

NIRVs are thought to sometimes confer virus resistance, meaning that they could impact spread of the virus in the host population. However, a NIRV that is expressed may also impact the evolution of virus populations within host organisms. Here, we experimentally addressed the evolution of a virus in a host expressing a NIRV using Tobacco etch virus (TEV), a plant RNA virus, and transgenic tobacco plants expressing its replicase, NIb. We found that a virus missing the NIb gene, TEV-\\u00c1NIb, which is incapable of autonomous replication in wild-type plants, had a higher fitness than the full-length TEV in the transgenic plants. Moreover, when the full-length TEV was evolved by serial passages in transgenic plants, we observed genomic deletions within NIb-and in some cases the adjacent cistrons-starting from the first passage. When we passaged TEV and TEV-\\u00c1NIb in transgenic plants, we found mutations in proteolytic sites, but these only occurred in TEV-\\u00c1NIb lineages, suggesting the adaptation of polyprotein processing to altered NIb expression. These results raise the possibility that NIRV expression can indeed induce the deletion of the corresponding genes in the viral genome, resulting in the formation of viruses that are replication defective in hosts that do not express the same NIRV. Moreover, virus genome evolution was contingent upon the deletion of the viral replicase, suggesting NIRV expression could also alter patterns of virus evolution. \",\n\"Shrinkage of Genome Size in a Plant RNA Virus upon Transfer of an Essential Viral Gene into the Host Genome[SEP]Nonretroviral integrated RNA viruses (NIRVs) are genes of nonretroviral RNA viruses found in the genomes of many eukaryotic organisms.

A trimerized version of the RNA aptamer matching the three RBDs in each spike complex enhances binding affinity down to the low picomolar range. Binding mode and specificity for the aptamer-spike interaction is supported by biolayer interferometry, single-molecule fluorescence microscopy, and flow-induced dispersion analysis in vitro. Cell culture experiments using virus-like particles and live SARS-CoV-2 show that the aptamer and, to a larger extent, the trimeric aptamer can efficiently block viral infection at low concentration.

The aim of these SARS-CoV-2 contact points was to ensure medical treatment for patients with (suspected) and without SARS-CoV-2 infection. The present study aimed to assess the beliefs and practices of primary care physicians who either led a Subspecialised Primary Care Practice or a Primary Care Practice providing care as usual in Baden-Wuerttemberg during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. This cross-sectional study was based on a paper-based questionnaire in primary care physicians during the first wave of the pandemic. Participants were identified via the web page of the Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians Baden-Wuerttemberg. The questionnaire was distributed in June and July 2020. It measured knowledge, practices, self-efficacy and fears towards SARS-CoV-2, using newly developed questions. Data was descriptively analysed. One hundred fifty-five participants (92 leads of SARS-CoV-2 contact points/ 63 leads of primary care practices) completed the questionnaire. Out of 92 leads of SARS-CoV-2 contact points 74 stated to lead n Subspecialised Primary Care Practices. About half participants of both groups did not fear an own infection with the novel virus (between 50.8% and 62.2%), however about 75% feared financial loss. Knowledge was gained using various sources; main sources were the Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians (between 82.5% and 83.8%) and the German Society for Hygiene and Microbiology (RKI) (between 88.9% and 95.9%). Leads of Subspecialised Primary Care Practice felt more confident to perform anamnestic/diagnostic procedures (p < 0.001). The same was found for the confidence level regarding decision-making concerning the further treatment (p < 0.001). Several prevention measures to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 were adopted.

Participants were identified via the web page of the Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians Baden-Wuerttemberg. The questionnaire was distributed in June and July 2020. It measured knowledge, practices, self-efficacy and fears towards SARS-CoV-2, using newly developed questions. Data was descriptively analysed. One hundred fifty-five participants (92 leads of SARS-CoV-2 contact points/ 63 leads of primary care practices) completed the questionnaire. Out of 92 leads of SARS-CoV-2 contact points 74 stated to lead n Subspecialised Primary Care Practices. About half participants of both groups did not fear an own infection with the novel virus (between 50.8% and 62.2%), however about 75% feared financial loss. Knowledge was gained using various sources; main sources were the Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians (between 82.5% and 83.8%) and the German Society for Hygiene and Microbiology (RKI) (between 88.9% and 95.9%). Leads of Subspecialised Primary Care Practice felt more confident to perform anamnestic/diagnostic procedures (p < 0.001). The same was found for the confidence level regarding decision-making concerning the further treatment (p < 0.001). Several prevention measures to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2 were adopted. Subspecialised Primary Care Practice had treated on average more patients with (suspected) COVID-19 (mean 408.12) than primary care practices (mean 83.8) (p < 0.001). \"],\n [\"To appear in: Nutrition\",\n\"The new Covid-19 pandemic has disproportionally affected a variety of patients with underlying risk factors such as respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, obesity, and African American race. Vitamin D deficiency that can result in compromised immune response has also been linked with increased risk and increased morbidities associated with Covid-19. In the absence of large scale longitudinal studies that can determine the strength of association between vitamin deficiency and Covid-19, cross sectional studies of large cohorts of patients can be used. We have used the i2b2 patient's registry platform at the University of Florida Health center to generate a count of patients using the ICD 10 diagnoses codes for the period of 10/1/2015 -6/30/2020. Logistic regression of the aggregates was used for the analysis. Results: Patients with vitamin D deficiency were 4.6 times more likely to be Covid-19 positive, as indicated by a COV19 ICD 10 diagnostic code, than patients with no deficiency (P-value<0.001). The association decreased slightly after adjusting for gender (with OR=4.58, p<0.001) and for malabsorption (with OR=4.46, p<0.001) respectively. The association decreased significantly but remained robust with P-value<0.001 after adjusting for race (with OR=3.76, p<0.001), periodontal disease status (with OR=3.64, p<0.001), diabetes (with OR=3.28, p<0.001) and obesity (with OR=2.27, p<0.001), respectively. In addition, patients with vitamin D deficiency were 5 times more likely to be infected with Covid-19 than patients with no deficiency after adjusting for age groups (OR=5.155, p<0.001).

Patients who have recovered from COVID-19 may still face persisting respiratory damage from the virus, necessitating long-term supervision after discharge to closely assess pulmonary function during rehabilitation. Therefore, developing portable spirometers for pulmonary function tests is of great significance for convenient home-based monitoring during recovery. Here, we propose a wireless, portable pulmonary function monitor for rehabilitation care after COVID-19. It is composed of a breath-to-electrical (BTE) sensor, a signal processing circuit, and a Bluetooth communication unit. The BTE sensor, with a compact size and light weight of 2.5 cm 3 and 1.8 g respectively, is capable of converting respiratory biomechanical motions into considerable electrical signals. The output signal stability is greater than 93% under 35%-81% humidity, which allows for ideal expiration airflow sensing. Through a wireless communication circuit system, the signals can be received by a mobile terminal and processed into important physiological parameters, such as forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1 ) and forced vital capacity (FVC). The FEV 1 /FVC ratio, is then calculated to further evaluate pulmonary function of testers. Through these measurement methods, the acquired pulmonary function parameters are shown to exhibit high accuracy (>97%) in comparison to a commercial spirometer. The practical design of the self-powered flow spirometer presents a low-cost and convenient method for pulmonary function monitoring during rehabilitation from COVID-19. \",\n\"Journal Pre-proof A portable triboelectric spirometer for wireless pulmonary function monitoring A portable triboelectric spirometer for wireless pulmonary function monitoring[SEP]Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as a severe acute respiratory syndrome infection has spread rapidly across the world since its emergence in 2019 and drastically altered our way of life.

Education is widely accepted to be the means of transformation of individuals so that they may achieve their unique success or create their own lives. However, not every individual seems to be realizing their true potential. This paper explores the concept of entropy in education system as a force that is usually imagined to oppose realization of potential of an individual during life in this phenomenal world. Alternatively, the same may provide an impetus that is necessary to bring in organization in oneself to realize the hidden potential. A one group Pretest-Posttest quasi-experimental design was used to draw the conclusions on data obtained from participants of workshops in three different modes, viz. face-to-face Pre COVID-19, faceto-face in COVID-19 with SOPs, and online in COVID-19. Realization of an individual's potential was represented as a dependent variable, i.e. transformation in cognition, skills, and attitude while the independent variables taken into account were the meaningful interactions of an individual with peers and advanced learners in a designed environment. It was inferred from the results that transformation in learners' cognition (6-30 %), skills (0-20 %), and attitude (5-32 %) occurred through human discourse, in a community of inquiry. \",\n\"Entropy in Education System: Transformation of an Individual Through Meaningful Interactions in a Community of Inquiry[SEP]Every individual is unique and may serve a unique purpose in this life.

Prevalence of anxiety for survey 1 and survey 2 were 14.9% and 14% and depression were 19.6% and 15.3%, respectively. Increased odds of anxiety and depression were associated with disrupted routines and lower socioeconomic status in both surveys, whereas depression was inversely related to the novel preventive routine of avoiding going to crowded places in survey 1. The prevalences of anxiety and depression were higher than preceding public health/social crises. A heavier burden of psychiatric conditions was evidenced amongst people experiencing disrupted daily routines across different phases of the pandemic and without novel preventive routines in the early phase. \",\n\"Psychiatric symptoms and behavioral adjustment during the COVID-19 pandemic: evidence from two population-representative cohorts[SEP]This study examined prevalences of anxiety and depression and their correlations with daily routines among Hong Kong Chinese during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The study objective was to assess 30-day outcomes (ED revisit, admission, ICU admission, and death) for low-risk patients discharged after ED evaluation for COVID-19. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study of patients triaged to a COVID-19 surge area within an urban ED and discharged between March 12 and April 6. Physicians were encouraged to discharge patients if they were well-appearing with few comorbidities. Data were collected from review of medical records and phone followup, and the analysis was descriptive. Results: Of 452 patients, the median age was 38, and 61.7% had no comorbidities. Chest radiographs were performed for 50.4% of patients and showed infiltrates in 14% of those tested. Polymerase chain reaction testing was performed for 28.3% of patients during the index ED visit and was positive in 35.9% of those tested. Followup was achieved for 75.4% of patients. ED revisits occurred for 13.7% of patients. The inpatient admission rate at 30 days was 4.6%, with 0.7% requiring intensive care. Median number of days between index ED evaluation and return for admission was 5 (interquartile range 3-7, range 1-17). There were no known deaths. Conclusions: A minority of low-risk patients with suspected COVID-19 will require hospitalization after being discharged home from the ED. Outpatient management is likely safe for well-appearing patients with normal vital signs, but patients should be instructed to return for worsening symptoms including labored breathing.

Thus, in the context of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, we examined whether two types of behaviors-those enacted to prevent the spread of disease to the self and others (positive health behaviors) and those enacted to promote others' psychological and financial well-being (prosocial behaviors)-might protect well-being over time. Using a longitudinal survey method, 745 participants (M age = 62.87 years) reported their engagement in positive health behaviors, prosocial behaviors, and socioemotional well-being (depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, loneliness) approximately two months into mandated lockdown orders in the USA. Three months later, participants again reported their well-being. Results showed that greater self-reported positive health behaviors (e.g., wearing a facemask, distancing from others) was related to decreased depressive symptoms over time, whereas greater self-reported prosocial behaviors (e.g., donating time or money, thanking an essential worker) was related to decreased loneliness over time. Neither behavior was related to anxiety symptoms. Together, results suggest that both doing things for the benefit of others and engaging in positive health behaviors protects well-being, even during times of chronic stress. Findings are however limited by the use of selfreport measures. Future research should use experimental and behavioral approaches beyond self-report to verify findings. \",\n\"Prosocial and Positive Health Behaviors During a Period of Chronic Stress Protect Socioemotional Well-Being[SEP]Behavior that helps, supports, or protects others-or prosocial behavior-has emerged as a health-relevant behavior that can promote the giver's well-being, yet whether prosocial behavior protects against the effects of a major, ongoing chronic stressor warrants further examination.

Although predictors such as age, gender, and disease staging are of considerable predictive value, the accuracy often ranges between 60 and 80%. An accurate prognosis assessment is required for making effective clinical decisions. We proposed an extended prognostic model based on clinical covariates with adjustment for additional variables that were radio-graphically induced, termed imaging biomarkers. Eight imaging biomarkers were introduced and investigated in a cohort of 68 non-small cell lung cancer subjects with tumor internal characteristic. The subjects comprised of 40 males and 28 females with mean age at 68.7 years. The imaging biomarkers used to quantify the solid component and non-solid component of a tumor. The extended model comprises of additional frameworks that correlate these markers to the survival ends through uni-and multi-variable analysis to determine the most informative predictors, before combining them with existing clinical predictors. Performance was compared between traditional and extended approaches using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, Area under the ROC curves (AUC), Kaplan-Meier (KM) curves, Cox Proportional Hazard, and log-rank tests (p-value). Results: The proposed hybrid model exhibited an impressive boosting pattern over the traditional approach of prognostic modelling in the survival prediction (AUC ranging from 77 to 97%). Four developed imaging markers were found to be significant in distinguishing between subjects having more and less dense components: (P = 0.002-0.006). The correlation to survival analysis revealed that patients with denser composition of tumor (solid dominant) lived 1.6-2.2 years longer (mean survival) and 0.5-2.0 years longer (median survival), than those with less dense composition (non-solid dominant). The present study provides crucial evidence that there is an added value for incorporating additional imagebased predictors while predicting clinical endpoints. Though the hypotheses were confirmed in a customized case study, we believe the proposed model is easily adapted to various clinical cases, such as predictions of complications, treatment response, and disease evolution. \",\n\"Leveraging hybrid biomarkers in clinical endpoint prediction[SEP]Background: Clinical endpoint prediction remains challenging for health providers.

Though the hypotheses were confirmed in a customized case study, we believe the proposed model is easily adapted to various clinical cases, such as predictions of complications, treatment response, and disease evolution. \"],\n [\"Activation of viral transcription by stepwise largescale folding of an RNA virus genome\",\n\"The genomes of RNA viruses contain regulatory elements of varying complexity. Many plus-strand RNA viruses employ largescale intra-genomic RNA-RNA interactions as a means to control viral processes. Here, we describe an elaborate RNA structure formed by multiple distant regions in a tombusvirus genome that activates transcription of a viral subgenomic mRNA. The initial step in assembly of this intramolecular RNA complex involves the folding of a large viral RNA domain, which generates a discontinuous binding pocket. Next, a distally-located protracted stem-loop RNA structure docks, via base-pairing, into the binding site and acts as a linchpin that stabilizes the RNA complex and activates transcription. A multi-step RNA folding pathway is proposed in which rate-limiting steps contribute to a delay in transcription of the capsid protein-encoding viral subgenomic mRNA. This study provides an exceptional example of the complexity of genome-scale viral regulation and offers new insights into the assembly schemes utilized by large intra-genomic RNA structures. \",\n\"Activation of viral transcription by stepwise largescale folding of an RNA virus genome[SEP]The genomes of RNA viruses contain regulatory elements of varying complexity.

Despite the promising theory, invariance principle-based approaches fail in common classification tasks, where invariant (causal) features capture all the information about the label. Are these failures due to the methods failing to capture the invariance? Or is the invariance principle itself insufficient? To answer these questions, we revisit the fundamental assumptions in linear regression tasks, where invariance-based approaches were shown to provably generalize OOD. In contrast to the linear regression tasks, we show that for linear classification tasks we need much stronger restrictions on the distribution shifts, or otherwise OOD generalization is impossible. Furthermore, even with appropriate restrictions on distribution shifts in place, we show that the invariance principle alone is insufficient. We prove that a form of the information bottleneck constraint along with invariance helps address key failures when invariant features capture all the information about the label and also retains the existing success when they do not. We propose an approach that incorporates both of these principles and demonstrate its effectiveness in several experiments. * equal contribution \",\n\"Invariance Principle Meets Information Bottleneck for Out-of-Distribution Generalization[SEP]The invariance principle from causality is at the heart of notable approaches such as invariant risk minimization (IRM) that seek to address out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization failures.

Cardiac damage is attributed mostly to the aberrant host response to acute respiratory infection. However, direct infection of cardiac tissue by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) also occurs. We examined here the cardiac tropism of SARS-CoV-2 in spontaneously beating human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs). These cardiomyocytes express the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor but not the transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) that mediates spike protein cleavage in the lungs. Nevertheless, SARS-CoV-2 infection of hiPSC-CMs was prolific; viral transcripts accounted for about 88% of total mRNA. In the cytoplasm of infected hiPSC-CMs, smooth-walled exocytic vesicles contained numerous 65-to 90-nm particles with canonical ribonucleocapsid structures, and virus-like particles with knob-like spikes covered the cell surface. To better understand how SARS-CoV-2 spreads in hiPSC-CMs, we engineered an expression vector coding for the spike protein with a monomeric emerald-green fluorescent protein fused to its cytoplasmic tail (S-mEm). Proteolytic processing of S-mEm and the parental spike were equivalent. Live cell imaging tracked spread of S-mEm cell-to-cell and documented formation of syncytia. A cell-permeable, peptide-based molecule that blocks the catalytic site of furin and furin-like proteases abolished cell fusion. A spike mutant with the single amino acid change R682S that disrupts the multibasic furin cleavage motif was fusion inactive. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 replicates efficiently in hiPSC-CMs and furin, and/or furin-like-protease activation of its spike protein is required for fusion-based cytopathology. This hiPSC-CM platform enables target-based drug discovery in cardiac COVID-19. IMPORTANCE Cardiac complications frequently observed in COVID-19 patients are tentatively attributed to systemic inflammation and thrombosis, but viral replication has occasionally been confirmed in cardiac tissue autopsy materials. We developed an in vitro model of SARS-CoV-2 spread in myocardium using induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. In these highly differentiated cells, viral transcription levels exceeded those previously documented in permissive transformed cell lines. To better understand the mechanisms of SARS-CoV-2 spread, we expressed a fluorescent version of its spike protein that allowed us to characterize a fusion-based cytopathic effect. A mutant of the spike protein with a single amino acid mutation in the furin/furin-like protease cleavage site lost cytopathic function.

Data were collected on socio-demographic factors, migration status, health information sources, barriers to accessing public healthcare services and influenza-related knowledge using a 201-item interviewer-assisted questionnaire. Among the different types of influenza, participants' awareness of avian influenza was greatest (81%), followed by H1N1 (78%), human influenza (61%) and pandemic influenza (35%). Logistic regression analyses identified 11 factors that significantly predicted a high level of knowledge about influenza.

Yet, little is known about how they are mentally coping with the pandemic-time changes to their lives. This study explores children and youths' self-reported subjective well-being (SWB) during the pandemic, and provides novel insights into the correlates of potential decrease, using data from a pan-Canadian online survey of 932 children/youth and their parents. SWB was measured based on perceived changes in 12 affective/emotional states. The results indicate that in spring 2020, at the height of the first wave of the pandemic, many children and youth were more bored (37.6%) and worried (31%) compared to pre-pandemic time. At the same time, many self-reported that they felt calmer (31.9%) and more rested (30%). A latent class analysis revealed that nearly half (49.4%) of surveyed children and youth reported patterns in changes in their emotional state that may contribute to lower SWB. Results from binomial logistic regression suggest that socio-demographic characteristics and size of the municipality were not associated with low pandemic-time SWB. Instead, other potentially modifiable factors such as having access to friends, indoor and outdoor spaces/places to play and exercise, and healthy movement behaviours during the pandemic, were correlated with a lower likelihood of reporting low SWB. The findings can inform pandemic-time public health policy relating to physical distancing, and in the longer term, mental and physical health promotion. The results will also help improve urban planning and design practices in creating healthier, more resilient and equitable communities. \",\n\"Subjective well-being of Canadian children and youth during the COVID-19 pandemic: The role of the social and physical environment and healthy movement behaviours[SEP]The current COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted daily behaviours of children and youth. Yet, little is known about how they are mentally coping with the pandemic-time changes to their lives. This study explores children and youths' self-reported subjective well-being (SWB) during the pandemic, and provides novel insights into the correlates of potential decrease, using data from a pan-Canadian online survey of 932 children/youth and their parents. SWB was measured based on perceived changes in 12 affective/emotional states. The results indicate that in spring 2020, at the height of the first wave of the pandemic, many children and youth were more bored (37.6%) and worried (31%) compared to pre-pandemic time. At the same time, many self-reported that they felt calmer (31.9%) and more rested (30%).

We conduct a panel data analysis of 74 industrialized and developing countries over 1980-2000. Our main finding is that gross inflows of FDI are strongly and positively influenced by population health in low-and middle-income countries. Our estimates suggest that raising life expectancy by one year increases gross FDI inflows by 9%, after controlling for other relevant variables. These findings are consistent with the view that health is an integral component of human capital for developing countries. \",\n\"The Effect of Population Health on Foreign Direct Investment Inflows to Low-and Middle-Income Countries[SEP]This paper investigates the effect of population health on gross inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI).

TB/HIV coinfections exert a tremendous burden on the host's immune system, and this has prompted the clinical use of immunomodulators to enhance host defences as an alternative therapeutic strategy. In this study, we modified the clinically used synthetic immunomodulatory pentapeptide, thymopentin (TP-5, RKDVY), with six arginine residues (RR-6, RRRRRR) at the N-and C-termini to obtain the cationic peptides, RR-11 (RKDVYRRRRRR-NH 2 ) and RY-11 (RRRRRRRKDVY-NH 2 ), respectively. The arginine residues conferred anti-mycobacterial activity to TP-5 in the peptides as shown by effective minimum inhibitory concentrations of 125 mg/L and killing efficiencies of >99.99% against both rifampicin-susceptible and -resistant Mycobacterium smegmatis. The immunomodulatory action of the peptides remained unaffected as shown by their ability to stimulate TNF-a production in RAW 264.7 mouse macrophage cells. A distinct change in surface morphology after peptide treatment was observed in scanning electron micrographs, while confocal microscopy and dye leakage studies suggested bacterial membrane disruption by the modified peptides. The modified peptides were non-toxic and did not cause hemolysis of rat red blood cells up to a concentration of 2000 mg/L. Moreover, RY-11 showed synergism with rifampicin and reduced the effective concentration of rifampicin, while preventing the induction of rifampicin resistance. The synthetic peptides may have a potential application in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised TB patients. \",\n\"Synthetic modifications of the immunomodulating peptide thymopentin to confer anti-mycobacterial activity[SEP]Effective global control of tuberculosis (TB) is increasingly threatened by the convergence of multidrugresistant TB and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

Public health surveillance indicates that the Omicron variant is significantly more contagious than the previously dominant VOC, B.1.617.2 (Delta). Several early reports demonstrated that Omicron exhibits a higher degree (~10-30-fold) of escape from antibody neutralization compared to earlier lineage variants. Therefore, it is critical to determine how well the second line of adaptive immunity, T cell memory, performs against Omicron in people following COVID-19 infection and/or vaccination. To that purpose, we analyzed a cohort (n=345 subjects) of two-or three-dose messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine recipients and COVID-19 post infection subjects (including those receiving 2 doses of mRNA vaccine after infection), recruited to the CDC-sponsored AZ HEROES research study, alongside 32 pre-pandemic control samples. We report that T cell responses against Omicron spike peptides were largely preserved in all cohorts with established immune memory. IFN-\\u03b3 producing T cell responses remained equivalent to the response against the ancestral strain (WA1/2020), with some (<20%) loss in IL-2 single-or IL-2+IFN\\u03b3+ polyfunctional responses. Three-dose vaccinated participants had similar responses to Omicron relative to convalescent or convalescent plus two-dose vaccinated groups and exhibited responses significantly higher than those receiving two mRNA vaccine doses. These results provide further evidence that a three-dose vaccine regimen benefits the induction of optimal functional T cell immune memory. \",\n\"Resilient T cell responses to B.1.1.529 (Omicron) SARS-CoV-2 variant[SEP]Emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 variant-of-concern (VOC) B.1.1.529 (Omicron) in late 2021 has raised alarm among scientific and health care communities due to a surprisingly large number of mutations in its spike protein.

Because children appear to be less severely affected than adults, their imaging appearances have not been extensively reported. Objective To systematically review available literature regarding imaging findings in paediatric cases of COVID-19. Materials and methods We searched four databases (Medline, Embase, Cochrane, Google Scholar) for articles describing imaging findings in children with COVID-19. We included all modalities, age <18 years, and foreign language articles, using descriptive statistics to identify patterns and locations of imaging findings, and their association with outcomes. Results Twenty-two articles were included, reporting chest imaging findings in 431 children, of whom 421 (97.7%) underwent CT. Criteria for imaging were lacking. At diagnosis, 143/421 (34.0%) had a normal CT. Abnormalities were more common in the lower lobes and were predominantly unilateral. The most common imaging pattern was ground-glass opacification (159/255, 62.4%). None of the studies described lymphadenopathy, while pleural effusions were rare (three cases). Improvement at followup CT imaging (3-15 days later) was seen in 29/100 (29%), remained normal in 25/100 (25%) and progressed in 9/100 (9%). Conclusion CT chest findings in children with COVID-19 are frequently normal or mild. Lower lobes are predominantly affected by patchy ground-glass opacification.

We conducted a conventional content analysis of written responses to three open-ended questions regarding the lasting impact of COVID-19. Results: Of 207 multidisciplinary respondents from 80 U.S. cities, 148 (71%) provided written responses to open-ended questions and 62 responses (42%) were related to personal, professional, or existential well-being. These responses were sorted into 4 major categories: personal burdens, professional burdens, personal benefits, and professional benefits. Respondents described burdens more commonly than they did benefits (67% versus 33% of comments, respectively). Personal burdens related to increased fear and uncertainty, fear of bringing the virus home, and a sense of collective grief. Professional burdens included a sense of exhaustion, a challenge with work-life balance, personal experiences with colleagues infected with the virus, and considerations of leaving healthcare altogether. Personal benefits included lessons-learned, an evolving sense of what matters, and improved work-life balance. Professional benefits included opportunities for professional development and a sense of professional purpose. : Pediatric palliative care clinicians perceive a breadth of impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic.

These standards are categorized into nine sections-Content, Quality and Validity, Accessibility, Unambiguous Identification, Technical Capacity, Administration and Governance, the Trial Registration Data Set (TRDS), Partner registries and Data Interchange Standards. This study compared the WHO's primary registries, and the US's ClinicalTrials.gov, to examine the implementation of ISCTR, with the aim of defining features of an interim ideal registry. The websites of the 18 registries were evaluated for 14 features that map to one or more of the nine sections of ISCTR, and assigned scores for their variations of these features. The assessed features include the nature of the content; the number and nature of fields to conduct a search; data download formats; the nature of the audit trail; the health condition category; the documentation available on a registry website; etc. The registries received scores for their particular variation of a given feature based on a scoring rationale devised for each individual feature analysed.

In the current study, this method was used to detect and classify IB viruses in field submissions. Procedure Over an 11-month period samples from 40 cases of suspected IB virus were received and 17 submissions were positive for IB virus by polymerase chain reaction. HRM curve analysis classified each strain as subgroup 1, 2 or 3 strain (12 submissions) or a strain that was unable to be classified (5 submissions). The 3\\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) and partial S1 gene nucleotide sequences for the 17 IB virus strains were determined and their identity with those of the relative reference strains compared to confirm the classifications generated using the HRM curve analysis.

Currently, a virulent PEDV CH/YNKM-8/2013 and a CV777 vaccine strain-like AH-M have been successfully isolated from the clinical samples. To dissect out the underlying pathogenic mechanism of virulent PEDV and clarify the differences between virulent and CV777 vaccine strainlike PEDV infections, we performed an iTRAQ-based comparative quantitative proteomic study of Vero cells infected with both PEDV strains. A total of 661 and 474 differentially expressed proteins were identified upon virulent and CV777 vaccine strain-like isolates infection, respectively. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis was employed to investigate the canonical pathways and functional networks involved in both PEDV infections. Comprehensive studies have revealed that the PEDV virulent strain suppressed protein synthesis of Vero cells through down-regulating mTOR as well as its downstream targets 4EBP1 and p70S6K activities, which were validated by immunoblotting. In addition, the virulent strain could activate NF-\\u03baB pathway more intensively than the CV777 vaccine strain-like isolate, and elicit stronger inflammatory cascades as well. These data might provide new insights for elucidating the specific pathogenesis of PEDV infection, and pave the way for the development of effective therapeutic strategies. Biological significance: Porcine epidemic diarrhea is now worldwide distributed and causing huge economic losses to swine industry. The immunomodulation and pathogenesis between PEDV and host, as well as the difference between virulent and attenuated strains of PEDV infections are still largely unknown.

These developments in international and US trade policy, including Washington's launch of a full-fledged trade war against China in March 2018, have converged disastrously with the outbreak of the novel coronavirus in November 2019 and the onset of a worldwide pandemic. Given the status of the USA as the world's hegemon since 1945, what is new here is the effort of the Trump administration to abdicate US leadership, jettison longstanding alliances, and turn back the clock on the country's close integration with the world economy. Already, greatly reduced flows of goods, services, and people have translated into radically reduced global growth, widespread business disruptions, and high unemployment. Remarkably, the White House has refused to recognize the severity of the pandemic and has undermined the precautions of the US science community. We argue that these multiple shocks constitute a major critical juncture on par with what the world community faced in 1945. However, in the twenty-first century we have seen that high levels of economic uncertainty and political instability have superseded the longheld notion that international interdependence would pull the world community through tough times such as these. Could the triple whammy of a destructive trade war, deadly pandemic, and secular decline of US leadership trigger a new generation of policy innovation and institution building on par with the post-1945 era? In terms of the global trade regime, it would be difficult to imagine a buoyant recovery of the world economy in the absence of a serious reckoning with the pattern of norm erosion that we identify here. \",\n\"International Trade Norms in the Age of Covid-19 Nationalism on the Rise?[SEP]Simultaneous with the rise of trade protectionism in the twenty-first century has been a resurgence in nationalist politics, most notably in the USA, the UK, and parts of the EU.

The goal of this study was to assess the role that medical equipment may potentially play in hospital acquired infections in four public health facilities in Uganda. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from December 2017 to January 2018 in four public health facilities in Uganda. Each piece of equipment from the neonatal department, imaging department or operating theatre were swabbed at three distinct points: a location in contact with the patient, a location in contact with the user, and a remote location unlikely to be contacted by either the patient or the user. The swabs were analyzed for bacterial growth using standard microbiological methods. Seventeen bacterial isolates were randomly selected and tested for susceptibility/resistance to common antibiotics. The data collected analyzed in STATA version 14. Results: A total of 192 locations on 65 equipment were swabbed, with 60.4% of these locations testing positive (116/192). Nearly nine of ten equipment (57/65) tested positive for contamination in at least one location, and two out of three equipment (67.7%) tested positive in two or more locations. Of the 116 contaminated locations 52.6% were positive for Bacillus Species, 14.7% were positive for coagulase negative staphylococcus, 12.9% (15/116) were positive for E. coli, while all other bacterial species had a pooled prevalence of 19.8%. Interestingly, 55% of the remote locations were contaminated compared to 66% of the user contacted locations and 60% of the patient contacted locations.

Our aim was to study body weight change after a hypercaloric high fat diet in lean and overweight people. 7 lean men (BMI=22.7 kg/m 2 , aged 25.2years) and 6 overweight men (BMI=26.7 kg/m 2 , aged 42.6years) received for 56 days, in addition to their usual diet, 760 kcal/day (79% fat). On day 0, 14 and 56, blood samples were taken and resting metabolic rate and substrate oxidation were measured by indirect calorimetry. On day 0 and 56, body composition was assessed by DEXA, visceral and subcutaneous fat by abdominal MRI and physical activity by actigraph. Insulin sensitivity was measured by Euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp (40mUI/m\\u00b2/mn). Results: no difference in insulin sensitivity was seen after overfeeding. Weight gain was significantly higher in overweight group, even after age adjustment (3.7kg vs. 1.16kg p=0.04). Abdominal fat was stored in subcutaneous adipose tissue for overweight subjects and in visceral fat for lean subjects (Delta visceral fat=-2.5cm 3 vs. +19cm 3 p=0.05; Delta subcutaneous fat=+ 44cm 3 vs. -14cm 3 p=0.05). We found a negative correlation between FFA and BMI, and in the overweight group only, an early lipolysis inhibition (FFA D0=415 vs. FFAD14=306 mmol/l p=0.04) associated with triglycerides rise (TGD0=1075 vs.TGD14=1473 mmol/l p=0.03) and insulin rise (InsD0=8.6 vs. InsD14=13.7mU/l p=0.03). Fat oxidation was lower at day 14 (OxLD0=0.86 vs. OxLD14=0.7mg/kg/mn). None of these results were found in the lean group. Conclusions: Overweight subjects show higher susceptibility to weight gain than lean subjects due to early lipolysis inhibition and fat oxidation decrease. T1:PS.02 Priego, T, The aim of this work was to determine the sex-associated differences in the expression of genes related with fuel uptake and utilization in different organs (white adipose tissue, muscle and liver) of rats in response to a high-fat (HF) diet. For this purpose, male and female Wistar rats were fed for 6 months with a normal-fat (NF) or an HF-diet. Body weight, blood metabolites, and the expression of genes involved in the fuel metabolism and partitioning in white adipose tissue (WAT), skeletal muscle and liver were measured. Female rats fed with HF-diet showed increased expression of genes related with energy influx in WAT (GLUT4, CD36, LPL) and with lipid utilization in muscle (PPAR-alpha, CPT1M). In contrast, male but not female rats showed increased hepatic PPAR-alpha and CPT1L mRNA expression, suggesting enhanced lipid handling and oxidation by this organ, and had higher triacylglycerol content in liver. These results show sex-dependent differences in fuel uptake and utilization between tissues in response to an HF-diet, with a higher capacity of females to store fat in adipose tissue and to oxidize fatty acids in muscle. These adaptations can help to explain the lower tendency of females of suffering from obesity-linked disorders under conditions of HF-diet consumption. Human aging is marked by a reduction in both GH and IGF-1 concentrations owing to a reduced GH secretion but no alteration in secretion frequency and half life. Calorie restriction (CR) in rodents extends lifespan and restores a youthful growth hormone (GH) secretory pattern. Aim: To evaluate the effect of different types of CR for 6 months on 11h GH secretory dynamics. Methods: Forty-three (36.8\\u00b11.0y) overweight (BMI 27.8\\u00b10.7) men and women were randomized to either; Control=100% of energy requirements; CR=25% restriction; CR+EX=12.5% CR +12.5% increase in energy expenditure by exercise; LCD=low calorie diet until 15% weight reduction followed by weight maintenance. At baseline and month 6 we assessed changes in body composition (DXA), abdominal visceral fat (CT) and GH secretory dynamics (11-h of 10-min blood sampling). Results: Weight change at 6 months was (CR: -10\\u00b11%, CR+EX:-10\\u00b11%, LCD:-14\\u00b11%). There were significant reductions in total fat mass (CR:-24\\u00b13%, CR+EX:-25\\u00b13%, LCD: -31\\u00b12%) and abdominal visceral fat (CR:-28\\u00b14%, CR+EX:-27\\u00b13%, LCD:-36\\u00b12%) in the 3 intervention groups. Mean 11h GH concentrations were not changed in CR or control but increased by 41\\u00b18% in CR+EX (p<.0001) and 53\\u00b18% in LCD (p<.0001) at month 6 owing to both increased secretory burst mass (CR+EX: 34\\u00b113%, LCD: 27\\u00b122%, p<0.05) and amplitude (CR+EX: 34\\u00b114%, LCD: 30\\u00b120%, p<0.05) but not to changes in burst frequency, inter-burst interval or GH half-life. Fasting ghrelin concentrations were significantly increased from baseline in all intervention groups however total IGF-1 concentrations were increased only in CR+EX (10\\u00b17%, p<0.05) and LCD (19\\u00b14%, p<0.001). Conclusion: Short-term CR in humans can modify growth hormone secretion in a manner that is opposite to the changes reported with aging. Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) feeding decreases body adiposity but the mechanisms involved are not clear. The aim of this study was to analyse whether alterations in uncoupling protein (UCP) expression in white and brown adipose tissues (WAT and BAT, respectively) and in skeletal muscle may be responsible for the effect of trans-10,cis-12 CLA on the size of body fat depots in hamsters. Animals were divided into three groups and fed an atherogenic diet with different amounts of trans-10,cis-12 CLA (0 control, 0.5, or 1 g/100 g diet) for 6 weeks. CLA feeding reduced adipose depot weights, but it had no effect on body weight. Leptin mRNA expression decreased in both subcutaneous and perirenal WAT depots, in accordance with lower adiposity, whereas resistin mRNA expression was not changed. Animals fed CLA had lower UCP1 mRNA levels in BAT (both doses of CLA) and in perirenal WAT (low dose), and lower UCP3 mRNA levels in subcutaneous WAT (high dose). UCP2 mRNA expression in WAT was not significantly affected by CLA feeding. Animals fed the high dose of CLA showed increased UCP3 and carnitine palmitoyl transferase-I (CPT-I) mRNA expression levels in skeletal muscle. In summary, induction of UCP1 or UCP2 in WAT and BAT is not likely to be responsible for the fat-reduction action of CLA, but the increased expression of UCP3 in skeletal muscle, together with a higher expression of CPT-I, may explain the reported effects of dietary CLA in lowering adiposity and increasing fatty acid oxidation by skeletal muscle. \",\n\"The results of a 56 days high fat overfeeding study. Why do overweight subjects gain more weight than lean subjects? Caloric restriction in non-obese people may reverse the age-induced impairment of the somatotropic axis Effects of trans-10,cis-12 conjugated linoleic acid on the expression of uncoupling proteins in hamsters fed an atherogenic diet[SEP]Although obesity incidence increases, people are not equal towards weight gain. Our aim was to study body weight change after a hypercaloric high fat diet in lean and overweight people. 7 lean men (BMI=22.7 kg/m 2 , aged 25.2years) and 6 overweight men (BMI=26.7 kg/m 2 , aged 42.6years) received for 56 days, in addition to their usual diet, 760 kcal/day (79% fat). On day 0, 14 and 56, blood samples were taken and resting metabolic rate and substrate oxidation were measured by indirect calorimetry. On day 0 and 56, body composition was assessed by DEXA, visceral and subcutaneous fat by abdominal MRI and physical activity by actigraph. Insulin sensitivity was measured by Euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp (40mUI/m\\u00b2/mn). Results: no difference in insulin sensitivity was seen after overfeeding. Weight gain was significantly higher in overweight group, even after age adjustment (3.7kg vs. 1.16kg p=0.04). Abdominal fat was stored in subcutaneous adipose tissue for overweight subjects and in visceral fat for lean subjects (Delta visceral fat=-2.5cm 3 vs. +19cm 3 p=0.05; Delta subcutaneous fat=+ 44cm 3 vs. -14cm 3 p=0.05). We found a negative correlation between FFA and BMI, and in the overweight group only, an early lipolysis inhibition (FFA D0=415 vs. FFAD14=306 mmol/l p=0.04) associated with triglycerides rise (TGD0=1075 vs.TGD14=1473 mmol/l p=0.03) and insulin rise (InsD0=8.6 vs. InsD14=13.7mU/l p=0.03). Fat oxidation was lower at day 14 (OxLD0=0.86 vs. OxLD14=0.7mg/kg/mn). None of these results were found in the lean group. Conclusions: Overweight subjects show higher susceptibility to weight gain than lean subjects due to early lipolysis inhibition and fat oxidation decrease. T1:PS.02 Priego, T, The aim of this work was to determine the sex-associated differences in the expression of genes related with fuel uptake and utilization in different organs (white adipose tissue, muscle and liver) of rats in response to a high-fat (HF) diet. For this purpose, male and female Wistar rats were fed for 6 months with a normal-fat (NF) or an HF-diet. Body weight, blood metabolites, and the expression of genes involved in the fuel metabolism and partitioning in white adipose tissue (WAT), skeletal muscle and liver were measured. Female rats fed with HF-diet showed increased expression of genes related with energy influx in WAT (GLUT4, CD36, LPL) and with lipid utilization in muscle (PPAR-alpha, CPT1M). In contrast, male but not female rats showed increased hepatic PPAR-alpha and CPT1L mRNA expression, suggesting enhanced lipid handling and oxidation by this organ, and had higher triacylglycerol content in liver. These results show sex-dependent differences in fuel uptake and utilization between tissues in response to an HF-diet, with a higher capacity of females to store fat in adipose tissue and to oxidize fatty acids in muscle. These adaptations can help to explain the lower tendency of females of suffering from obesity-linked disorders under conditions of HF-diet consumption. Human aging is marked by a reduction in both GH and IGF-1 concentrations owing to a reduced GH secretion but no alteration in secretion frequency and half life. Calorie restriction (CR) in rodents extends lifespan and restores a youthful growth hormone (GH) secretory pattern. Aim: To evaluate the effect of different types of CR for 6 months on 11h GH secretory dynamics. Methods: Forty-three (36.8\\u00b11.0y) overweight (BMI 27.8\\u00b10.7) men and women were randomized to either; Control=100% of energy requirements; CR=25% restriction; CR+EX=12.5% CR +12.5% increase in energy expenditure by exercise; LCD=low calorie diet until 15% weight reduction followed by weight maintenance. At baseline and month 6 we assessed changes in body composition (DXA), abdominal visceral fat (CT) and GH secretory dynamics (11-h of 10-min blood sampling). Results: Weight change at 6 months was (CR: -10\\u00b11%, CR+EX:-10\\u00b11%, LCD:-14\\u00b11%). There were significant reductions in total fat mass (CR:-24\\u00b13%, CR+EX:-25\\u00b13%, LCD: -31\\u00b12%) and abdominal visceral fat (CR:-28\\u00b14%, CR+EX:-27\\u00b13%, LCD:-36\\u00b12%) in the 3 intervention groups. Mean 11h GH concentrations were not changed in CR or control but increased by 41\\u00b18% in CR+EX (p<.0001) and 53\\u00b18% in LCD (p<.0001) at month 6 owing to both increased secretory burst mass (CR+EX: 34\\u00b113%, LCD: 27\\u00b122%, p<0.05) and amplitude (CR+EX: 34\\u00b114%, LCD: 30\\u00b120%, p<0.05) but not to changes in burst frequency, inter-burst interval or GH half-life. Fasting ghrelin concentrations were significantly increased from baseline in all intervention groups however total IGF-1 concentrations were increased only in CR+EX (10\\u00b17%, p<0.05) and LCD (19\\u00b14%, p<0.001).

This study uses a Markov-switching model (MSM) proposed by Hamilton (1989) to analyze the Taiwanese tourist hotel industry cycle. The MSM decomposes the tourist hotel industry cycle into two distinct states: high-growth and low-growth (HGS and LGS). The mean growth rate of HGS is 1.5% and the average growth rate of LGS is 0.07% during the period from December 1999 to February 2011. The corresponding standard deviations in the two regimes are 0.008% and 0.038%, implying that HGS is more stable than LGS. Moreover, the probability of staying in HGS is 94% and the probability of remaining in LGS is 65%. The expected durations of HGS and LGS are about 16 and 3 months, respectively. Further, the paper investigates the factors that keep the THI in HGS. Empirical test results show that growth in the international tourism market and industrial production growth rate are two key factors that keep the THI in HGS, but the SARS outbreak in 2003 has had an adverse effect. \",\n\"Determinants of the Taiwanese tourist hotel industry cycle[SEP]This paper contributes to the tourism literature by examining determinants of the Taiwanese tourist hotel industry (THI) cycle.

Nsp14 forms a stable complex with non-structural protein Nsp10 and exhibits exoribonuclease and N7-methyltransferase activities. Protein-interactome studies identified human sirtuin 5 (SIRT5) as a putative binding partner of Nsp14. SIRT5 is an NAD-dependent protein deacylase critical for cellular metabolism that removes succinyl and malonyl groups from lysine residues. Here we investigated the nature of this interaction and the role of SIRT5 during SARS-CoV-2 infection. We showed that SIRT5 stably interacts with Nsp14, but not with Nsp10, suggesting that SIRT5 and Nsp10 are parts of separate complexes. We found that SIRT5 catalytic domain is necessary for the interaction with Nsp14, but that Nsp14 does not appear to be directly deacylated by SIRT5. Furthermore, knock-out of SIRT5 or treatment with specific SIRT5 inhibitors reduced SARS-CoV-2 viral levels in cell-culture experiments. SIRT5 knock-out cells expressed higher basal levels of innate immunity markers and mounted a stronger antiviral response.

We conducted a cohort study using South Korea's nationwide healthcare database, which contains data of all subjects who received a test for COVID-19 (n=69,793) as of April 8, 2020. We identified adults hospitalized with COVID-19, where cohort entry was the date of hospitalization. NSAIDs users were those prescribed NSAIDs in the 7 days before and including cohort entry and non-users were those not prescribed NSAIDs during this period. Our primary outcome was a composite of in-hospital death, intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation use, and sepsis; our secondary outcomes were cardiovascular complications and acute renal failure. We conducted logistic regression analysis to estimate odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) using inverse probability of treatment weighting to minimize confounding. : Of 1,824 adults hospitalized with COVID-19 (mean age 49.0 years; female 59%), 354 were NSAIDs users and 1,470 were non-users. Compared with non-use, NSAIDs use was associated with increased risks of the primary composite outcome (OR 1.54 [95% CI 1.13-2.11]) but insignificantly associated with cardiovascular complications (1.54 [0.96-2.48]) or acute renal failure (1.45 [0.49-4.14]). CONCLUSION: While awaiting the results of confirmatory studies, we suggest NSAIDs be used with caution among patients with COVID-19 as the harms associated with their use may outweigh their benefits in this population. \",\n\"Association between NSAIDs use and adverse clinical outcomes among adults hospitalized with COVID-19 in South Korea: A nationwide study[SEP]BACKGROUND: Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may exacerbate COVID-19 and worsen associated outcomes by upregulating the enzyme that SARS-CoV-2 binds to enter cells.

Infection with SARS-CoV-2 can cause mild to life-threatening illness due to activated immune responses that may be dampened by MSCs or their secretome. Many clinical studies of MSCs have been launched since the beginning of the global pandemic, however, few have been completed and most lack power to assess efficacy. Repeated systematic searches and meta-analyses are needed to understand, in real time, the extent of potential benefit in different patient populations as the evidence emerges. Methods: This living systematic review will be maintained to provide up-to-date information as the pandemic evolves. A systematic literature search of Embase, MEDLINE, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases will be performed.

Early signals of a firm's research success\",\n\"Scientific and technological progress is largely driven by firms in many domains, including artificial intelligence and vaccine development. However, we do not know yet whether the success of firms' research activities exhibits dynamic regularities and some degree of predictability. By inspecting the research lifecycles of 7,440 firms, we find that the economic value of a firm's early patents is an accurate predictor of various dimensions of a firm's future research success. At the same time, a smaller set of future top-performers do not generate early patents of high economic value, but they are detectable via the technological value of their early patents. Importantly, the observed predictability cannot be explained by a cumulative advantage mechanism, and the observed heterogeneity of the firms' temporal success patterns markedly differs from patterns previously observed for individuals' research careers. Our results uncover the dynamical regularities of the research success of firms, and they could inform managerial strategies as well as policies to promote entrepreneurship and accelerate human progress. arXiv:2108.00200v1 [physics.soc-ph] 31 Jul 2021 \",\n\"Citations or dollars?

Overall, the pandemic resulted in fewer trips in areas with higher proportions of seniors and more trips to parks and green spaces. Ridesourcing demand was adversely affected by the stringency index and COVID-19-related variables, and positively affected by vaccination rates.

Since the start of 2021, there has been a significant increase in infections in Africa, with new and different variants of SARS-CoV-2. However, little has been published on the impact of Covid-19 in low-resource settings and the role of critical care nurses and services. This critical commentary is partly based on our reflections as members of a health partnership in Zambia, to capacity build Emergency, Trauma and Critical Care Nursing and also utilises current available evidence. The focus, worldwide, has been on the numbers of cases and numbers requiring critical care services. However, in countries with a limited critical care workforce and resources, it only takes a few cases to overwhelm the health care system. For example, oxygen is classed as an essential drug by the WHO; however, it remains limited in many low-middle income countries' (LMIC) hospital settings. 3 Now, 1 year on since the start of the pandemic, the WHO still identifies access to oxygen in LMIC as limited due to cost, infrastructure and logistical barriers. 4 This is a cause for concern as hospitals that are unable to provide a continuous supply of oxygen or electricity to run oxygen concentrators may result in unnecessary loss of life. Critical care services are an essential, integral service needed for the provision of comprehensive health care systems and should be seen as essential to achieving universal access to health care. 5 However, critics argue that specialist services such as critical care do not necessarily significantly decrease overall mortality; therefore, the development of these services in low-resource settings is unrealistic and instead investment should focus on primary health care projects. 6 Prior to the pandemic, the limited number of emergency, trauma and critical care staff were responding to the \\\"silent epidemic\\\" of rising trauma, communicable and non-communicable disease and the need to provide safe surgery, 7-9 with little recognition or support. In addition, the reality is that often emergency, trauma and critical care nurses are the only trained specialists within many LMIC hospital settings, due to the limited numbers of doctors. Therefore, they are expected to provide guidance and support across the hospital, as well as deliver critical care nursing. For many countries, the short-, medium-and long-term impacts of Covid-19 have arisen not only from the virus itself but from funding being diverted to provide immediate and essential pandemic services. Sadly, the hard-won reductions in communicable and non-communicable diseases are in danger of being reversed, and we do not know the longer-term impact on an exhausted and over-extended workforce. Then too, in many LMICs, the situation is compounded by the economic damage, which includes a high inflation rate with the rising cost of food and increased unplanned expenditure in terms of illness and funerals causing emotional stress and anxiety. 10 \",\n\"Covid-19 1 year on: The challenge for low-middle income countries[SEP]History has shown that epidemics are a story of inequalities. 1 In early 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) described the pandemic as a public health emergency of international concern. 2 In many countries, this meant that the demand for critical care services has exceeded availability in terms of workforce, resources and equipment.

Survey evidence has documented skepticism in a diverse set of issues including climate change, vaccine hesitancy, and, most recently, COVID-19 risks. Less well understood is whether these beliefs alter high-stakes behavior. Combining GPS data for 2.7 million smartphone users in Florida and Texas with 2016 U.S. presidential election precinct-level results, we examine how conservative-media dismissals of hurricane advisories in 2017 influenced evacuation decisions.

A dispersive graphene metasurface is designed to produce chiral surface currents to couple linearly polarized incident fields to circularly polarized reflected fields. The metasurface sensing sensitivity is the result of surface plasmon currents that flow in a chiral fashion with strong intensity due to the underlying geometrical resonance. Consequently, unique polarization states are observed in the far-field with the ellipticity values that change rapidly with the analyte's RI. The determination of bimolecular RI is treated as an inverse problem in which the polarization states of the virus is compared with a pre-calculated calibration model that is obtained by full-wave electromagnetic simulations.

Methods: The projected impact of the pandemic on child marriage is based on a Markov model. A review of empirical and theoretical literature informed construction and parameter estimates of five pathways through which we expect an elevated marriage hazard: death of a parent, interruption of education, pregnancy risk, household income shocks, and reduced access to programs and services. Models are produced for an unmitigated scenario and a mitigated scenario in which effective interventions are applied to reduce the impact. Results: The total number of excess child marriages in these five countries could range from 3.5 million to 4.9 million in the unmitigated scenario and from 1.8 million to 2.7 million in the mitigated scenario. The elevated risk compared with the baseline projection would continue until 2035. Conclusions: These projections represent the impact in five countries that account for 50% of child marriages globally, implying that if similar patterns hold, we might expect the number of excess child marriages due to the pandemic to reach 7 million to 10 million globally. These estimates are necessarily subject to high levels of uncertainty because of limited evidence on the impacts in relation to child marriage and for parameter estimates. It will likely take years to understand the full impact of the pandemic. Despite these limitations, the potential for harm is unquestionably large. \",\n\"Projecting the Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Child Marriage[SEP]Purpose: The study projects the potential impact of COVID-19 on child marriage in the five countries in which the burden of child marriage is the largest: Bangladesh, Brazil, Ethiopia, India, and Nigeria.

Though generally assumed to be selective for cellular transcripts, the extent to which SOX impacts viral mRNA stability has remained unknown. We addressed this issue using the model murine gammaherpesvirus MHV68 and, unexpectedly, found that all stages of viral gene expression are controlled through mRNA degradation. Using both comprehensive RNA expression profiling and half-life studies we reveal that the levels of the majority of viral mRNAs but not noncoding RNAs are tempered by MHV68 SOX (muSOX) activity. The targeting of viral mRNA by muSOX is functionally significant, as it impacts intracellular viral protein abundance and progeny virion composition. In the absence of muSOX-imposed gene expression control the viral particles display increased cell surface binding and entry as well as enhanced immediate early gene expression. These phenotypes culminate in a viral replication defect in multiple cell types as well as in vivo, highlighting the importance of maintaining the appropriate balance of viral RNA during gammaherpesviral infection. This is the first example of a virus that fails to broadly discriminate between cellular and viral transcripts during host shutoff and instead uses the targeting of viral messages to fine-tune overall gene expression. \",\n\"Gammaherpesviral Gene Expression and Virion Composition Are Broadly Controlled by Accelerated mRNA Degradation[SEP]Lytic gammaherpesvirus infection restricts host gene expression by promoting widespread degradation of cytoplasmic mRNA through the activity of the viral endonuclease SOX.

However, studies using clinical specimens that support the role of PD-1 and PD-L1 in patients with underlying atherosclerosis are also detailed. Of note, delicate balances in the expression levels of PD-L1 that are needed to preserve T cell immunity and to curtail acute as well as chronic infections in underlying blood vessel diseases are discussed.

Kakkonto (Gegen-tang in Chinese), one of the most frequently prescribed traditional Japanese (Kampo) medicines, is used for treating common cold, shoulder stiffness, or inflammatory diseases of the upper body. Previous experimental studies have indicated that kakkonto exerts antiviral and anti-inflammatory effects on the influenza virus and the human respiratory syncytial virus. However, there is a lack of reports investigating the efficacy of kakkonto in RV infection. Hence, the aim of the current study was to investigate the effects of kakkonto on RV infection of human nasal epithelial (HNE) cells. HNE cells obtained via endoscopic sinus surgery were cultured and infected with RV14, with or without kakkonto treatment. The supernatants from the cells were collected, and the RV14 titer and cytokine levels were assessed. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was performed to determine the amount of viral RNA, while the level of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\\u03baB) subunits in the nucleus was assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Although kakkonto treatment did not reduce RV14 titer or RNA levels, indicating that it did not inhibit RV14 proliferation, it was found to reduce the production of specific pro-inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-8, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\\u03b1, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1). Unlike that observed with the kakkonto extract, none of the crude drugs contained in kakkonto reduced IL-8 level.

We included patients with the diagnostic of PM based on appearance on Gram stain, a positive latex agglutination reaction of cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) samples and/or a positive culture for Streptococcus pneumoniae (CSF culture or blood culture and concomitant meningitis). We defined \\\"recurrent meningitis\\\" as at least two episodes of meningitis, separated by a period of at least 4 weeks. We identified a total of 194 PM episodes in 182 patients. Thirty eight (20 %) patients were diagnosed with recurrent meningitis, and they had 93 prior episodes recorded. The majority of patients with recurrent meningitis experienced two meningitis episodes, but we found 3 patients with 7, 11 and 40 recurrent episodes. Nineteen (50 %) patients in recurrent meningitis group and 90 (58 %) in non-recurrent group were men. Median age of patients with recurrent versus non-recurrent meningitis was 29 versus 57 years (p < 0.001). Nine (24 %) patients with recurrent meningitis versus 64 (41 %) patients with non-recurrent meningitis had an underlying immunosuppressive condition (p = 0.02, OR:0.41, 95 % CI:0.18-0.92). The immunosuppression was: diabetes mellitus in 32 (44 %), alcoholism in 19 (26 %), endstage liver disease in 7 (9.5 %) and malignancy, malnutrition, pregnancy, splenectomy and immunosuppressive therapy in 15 (20.5 %). We found dissemination of infection from a contiguous site in 74 (38 %) cases, bone defects and/or CSF leakage in 36 (18.5 %) cases and hematogenous spread in 14 (7.2 %) cases.

Because most electron microscopists in pathology are not accustomed to analysing viral particles and subcellular structures, our review aims to discuss the ultrastructural changes associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 with respect to pathology, virology, and electron microscopy. Using micrographs from infected cell cultures and autopsy tissues, we show how coronavirus replication affects ultrastructure and put the morphological findings in the context of viral replication, which induces extensive remodelling of the intracellular membrane systems. Virions assemble by budding into the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate complex and are characterized by electron dense dots of cross-sections of the nucleocapsid inside the viral particles. Physiological mimickers such as multivesicular bodies or coated vesicles serve as perfect decoys. Compared to other in-situ techniques, transmission electron microscopy is the only method to visualize assembled virions in tissues and will be required to prove SARS-CoV-2 replication outside the respiratory tract. In practice, documenting in tissues the characteristic features seen in infected cell cultures, seems to be much more difficult than anticipated. In our view, the hunt for coronavirus by transmission electron microscopy is still on. \",\n\"Title: Hunting coronavirus by transmission electron microscopy -a guide to SARS-CoV-2- associated ultrastructural pathology in COVID-19 tissues Full affiliations[SEP]Transmission electron microscopy has become a valuable tool to investigate tissues of COVID-19 patients because it allows visualisation of SARS-CoV-2, but the \\\"virus-like particles\\\" described in several organs have been highly contested.

We review the zoonotic source of highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses and their genesis from their natural reservoirs. The acquisition of novel traits, including lethality to waterfowl, ferrets, felids, and humans, indicates an expanding host range. The natural selection of nonpathogenic viruses from heterogeneous subpopulations cocirculating in ducks contributes to the spread of H5N1 in Asia. Transmission of highly pathogenic H5N1 from domestic poultry back to migratory waterfowl in western China has increased the geographic spread. The spread of H5N1 and its likely reintroduction to domestic poultry increase the need for good agricultural vaccines. In fact, the root cause of the continuing H5N1 pandemic threat may be the way the pathogenicity of H5N1 viruses is masked by cocirculating influenza viruses or bad agricultural vaccines. \",\n\"H5N1 Outbreaks and Enzootic Influenza[SEP]Ongoing outbreaks of H5N1 avian influenza in migratory waterfowl, domestic poultry, and humans in Asia during the summer of 2005 present a continuing, protean pandemic threat.

Methods: An SH3PXD2A-AS1 expression dataset was retrieved and analyzed from The Cancer Genome Atlas database, and SH3PXD2A-AS1 expression was determined in our cohort of 134 ESCC patients by using quantitative PCR. The clinical significance of SH3PXD2A-AS1 expression was investigated by the Chi square test and its prognostic value was determined by Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis and Cox proportional hazards analysis. RNA interference and in vitro functional experiments, including cell viability, migration, and invasion, were used to investigate effects of SH3PXD2A-AS1 on cell malignant phenotype. Results: SH3PXD2A-AS1 expression was increased in ESCC tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. A high level of SH3PXD2A-AS1 expression was associated with poor tumor differentiation and advanced T, N, and TNM stages, indicating its oncogenic role in ESCC. Moreover, its high expression predicted poor overall survival in patients with ESCC. Inhibition of SH3PXD2A-AS1 expression significantly suppressed cell viability, migration, and invasion of ESCC cells. \",\n\"High expression of the long noncoding RNA SH3PXD2A- AS1 is associated with poor prognosis in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma[SEP]Objective: Our objective was to explore the prognostic role of long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) SH3PXD2A-AS1 in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).

In this paper, we present a new way of measuring worry about catching COVID-19 that distinguishes between worry as a negative experience that damages people's quality of life (dysfunctional) and worry as an adaptive experience that directs people's attention to potential problems (functional). Drawing on work into fear of crime, our classification divides people into three groups: (1) the unworried, (2) the functionally worried (where worry motivates proactive behaviours that help people to manage their sense of risk) and (3) the dysfunctionally worried (where quality of life is damaged by worry and/or precautionary behaviour). Analysing data from two waves of a longitudinal panel study of over 1000 individuals living in ten cities in England, Scotland and Wales, we find differing levels of negative anxiety, anger, loneliness, unhappiness and life satisfaction for each of the three groups, with the dysfunctionally worried experiencing the most negative outcomes and the functionally worried experiencing less negative outcomes than unworried. We find no difference between groups in compliance and willingness to re-engage in social life. Finally, we show a difference between the dysfunctionally worried compared with functional and unworried groups in perceptions of risk (differentiating between likelihood, control and consequence). This finding informs what sort of content-targeted messaging aimed at reducing dysfunctional worry might wish to promote.

SND more generally occurs in the elderly population and is associated with impaired pacemaker function causing abnormal heart rhythm. Individuals with SND have a variety of symptoms including sinus bradycardia, sinus arrest, SAN block, bradycardia/tachycardia syndrome, and syncope. Importantly, individuals with SND report chronotropic incompetence in response to stress and/or exercise. SND may be genetic or secondary to systemic or cardiovascular conditions. Current management of patients with SND is limited to the relief of arrhythmia symptoms and pacemaker implantation if indicated. Lack of effective therapeutic measures that target the underlying causes of SND renders management of these patients challenging due to its progressive nature and has highlighted a critical need to improve our understanding of its underlying mechanistic basis of SND. This review focuses on current information on the genetics underlying SND, followed by future implications of this knowledge in the management of individuals with SND. \",\n\"Genetic Complexity of Sinoatrial Node Dysfunction[SEP]The pacemaker cells of the cardiac sinoatrial node (SAN) are essential for normal cardiac automaticity.

This article focuses on three contemporary relationships amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic: (1) school mathematics and national health, (2) mathematics educators' roles in distinguishing the health needs of students, and (3) mathematics instruction as either enhancing or threatening students' mental health and social adjustment. We argue that these concerns are foundational preoccupations of mathematics education research that have persistently shaped debates over who should learn mathematics, how, and to what ends. Our study examines histories of school mathematics and health discourses to explore how particular notions of health entered US mathematics education during the 19th and early twentieth centuries in ways that resonate with recent research trends and responses to COVID-19. We especially attend to how health/pathology distinctions reconfigured hierarchies of nationality, sex, race, and dis/ability within exclusionary, segregated, colonial, and tracked mathematics instruction. By mapping some of the shifting contours of health and pathology over time, we emphasize the potential dangers of the pandemic reanimating long-circulating dividing practices, such as in emerging trends comparing national metrics of well-being, responding to perceived trauma with differentiated instruction, and seeking to calibrate healthy mathematics identities in marginalized groups. \",\n\"Health and pathology: a brief history of the biopolitics of US mathematics education[SEP]Concerns about health and disease have long pervaded mathematics education research, yet their implications have been underappreciated.

Methods: We conducted a pre-post study of E-consult implementation for positive ANA referrals. We retrospectively reviewed \\\"positive ANA\\\" referrals from 1/2015-3/2017. A statistical process control chart was created to display monthly average wait times for in-person clinic visits and to identify special cause variation. Final diagnoses, wait times and resource utilization were recorded and compared between E-consults and in-person referrals. Results: There were 139 referrals for positive ANA with 126 occurring after E-consult implementation in August 2015. Forty-four percent (55/126) of referrals were E-consults; 76% did not have an in-person visit after initial electronic rheumatology recommendation. A control chart demonstrated special cause variation in the form of a shift from June 2016 -January 2017, suggesting a temporal association between decreased wait times and the implementation of E-consults. Eleven patients were diagnosed with ANA-associated rheumatic disease; the majority of patients (73%, 86/139) did not have a rheumatologic diagnosis. Overall E-consults utilized more labs than inperson visits, but this was not statistically significant. In-person visits utilized more imaging studies, which was statistically significant. Conclusion: E-consults are an effective way to address positive ANA consults without significant increase in resource utilization and were temporally associated with decreased wait times for in-person visits. \",\n\"E-consults: an effective way to decrease clinic wait times in rheumatology[SEP]Background: To evaluate the effect of E-consults on wait times and resource utilization for positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) referrals in outpatient rheumatology.

The implications of low healthcare trust permeate throughout the industry in a number of ways, most visibly by discouraging therapy compliance. Methods This study investigated four putative determinants of trust in healthcare-related scenarios: individuals vs. collective groups as communicators of healthcare advice; expert vs. laypeople as providers of healthcare communication; public vs. private healthcare sector; and positive vs. negative information. Two hundred seventy-four participants were recruited via Prolific Academic and were presented with four statements in random order, related to a positive reflection of the public healthcare sector, a negative reflection of the public healthcare sector, a positive reflection of the private healthcare sector and a negative reflection of the private healthcare sector. According to these reflection, participants were repeatedly asked to rate the system on its trustworthiness. Trust outcomes were constructed using a four-dimension framework, consisting of benevolence, reliability, competence and predictability. Results Claims relating to the public sector had a significantly stronger impact on benevolence and reliability than claims relating to the private sector; claims from individuals had a significantly stronger impact on all trust variables than claims from collectives; and claims from laypeople had a significantly greater impact on reliability and competence ratings than claims from experts. Conclusions The findings in this study offer insight into the patterns with which trust decisions are made in healthcare contexts. More importantly, this research offers a novel perspective of how different factors interact to affect the various facets of trust. These results provide a foundation for future study in this evolving area, and offer insights into designing effective communication strategies that cultivate greater levels of individual trust in the healthcare sector. \",\n\"How healthcare structures and communication delivery influence trust: a parallel-group randomized controlled trial[SEP]Background According to recent polling, public trust in the healthcare sector remains low relative to other industries globally.

Our objectives were to develop a systematic approach for reporting likelihood of COVID-19 pneumonia on chest CXR, to measure the interobserver variability of this approach and to evaluate the diagnostic performance of CXR compared to real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Retrospective review of patients suspected of having COVID-19 pneumonia who attended our emergency department and underwent both CXR and a RT-PCR were included. Two radiologists reviewed the CXRs, blind to the RT-PCR, and classified them according to a structured reporting template with five categories (Characteristic, High Suspicion, Indeterminate, Unlikely and Normal) which we devised. For analysis of diagnostic accuracy, Characteristic and High Suspicion CXRs were considered positive and the remaining categories negative. Concordance between the two assessors was also assessed. Results: Of 582 patients (51 +/-20 years), 143/582 (24.6%) had a positive RT-PCR.

Bats, among mammals, are pointed to harbor a significantly higher proportion of unknown or emerging viruses with zoonotic potential. Herein, we report the isolation of a novel rhabdovirus, detected in the framework of a virological survey on bats implemented in North Italy. Methods: Virus isolation and identification were performed on samples of 635 bats by using cell cultures, negative staining electron microscopy and PCRs for different viruses. NGS was commonly performed on cell culture supernatants showing cytopathic effect or in case of samples resulted positive by at least one of the PCRs included in the diagnostic protocol. Results: A rhabdovirus was isolated from different organs of a Pipistrellus kuhlii. Virus identification was obtained by electron microscopy and NGS sequencing. The complete genome size was 11,774 nt comprised 5 genes, encoding the canonical rhabdovirus structural proteins, and an additional transcriptional unit (U1) encoding a hypothetical small protein (157aa) (3'-N-P-M-G-U1-L-5\\u2032). The genome organization and phylogenetic analysis suggest that the new virus, named Vaprio virus (VAPV), belongs to the recently established genus Ledantevirus (subgroup B) and it is highly divergent to its closest known relative, Le Dantec virus (LDV) (human, 1965 Senegal). A specific RT-PCR amplifying a 350 bp fragment of the ORF 6 gene, encoding for L protein, was developed and used to test retrospectively a subset of 76 bats coming from the same area and period, revealing two more VAPV positive bats. Conclusions: VAPV is a novel isolate of chiropteran rhabdovirus.

As these are often improperly disposed of, they represent an important potential source of microplastics in the environment. We prepared microplastics from polypropylene medical masks and characterised their size, shape, organic chemical leaching, and acute toxicity to the planktonic crustacean Daphnia magna. The three layers of the masks were separately milled and characterised. Each of the inner frontal, middle filtering, and outer layers yielded different types of microplastics: fibres were obtained from the inner and outer layer, but irregular fragments from the middle layer. The shape of the obtained microplastics differed from the initial fibrous structure of the intact medical mask layers, which indicates that the material is deformed during cryomilling. The chemical compositions of plastics-associated chemicals also varied between the different layers. Typically, the inner layer contained more chemicals related to antimicrobial function and flavouring. The other two layers also contained antioxidants and their degradation products, plasticisers, cross-linking agents, antistatic agents, lubricants, and non-ionic surfactants. An acute study with D. magna showed that these microplastics do not cause immobility but do physically interact with the daphnids. Further long-term studies with these microplastics are needed using a suite of test organisms. Indeed, studies with other polypropylene microplastics have shown numerous adverse effects on other organisms at concentrations that have already been reported in the environment. Further efforts should be made to investigate the environmental hazards of polypropylene microplastics from medical masks and how to handle this new source of environmental burden. \",\n\"Environmental hazard of polypropylene microplastics from disposable medical masks: acute toxicity towards Daphnia magna and current knowledge on other polypropylene microplastics Microplastics and Nanoplastics[SEP]The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the use of disposable plastics, including medical masks, which have become a necessity in our daily lives.

An acute study with D. magna showed that these microplastics do not cause immobility but do physically interact with the daphnids. Further long-term studies with these microplastics are needed using a suite of test organisms. Indeed, studies with other polypropylene microplastics have shown numerous adverse effects on other organisms at concentrations that have already been reported in the environment. Further efforts should be made to investigate the environmental hazards of polypropylene microplastics from medical masks and how to handle this new source of environmental burden. \"],\n [\"Social Isolation and Loneliness Among San Francisco Bay Area Older Adults During the COVID-19 Shelter-in-Place Orders\",\n\"Background/Objectives: Physical distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic may have unintended, detrimental effects on social isolation and loneliness among older adults. Our objectives were to investigate 1) experiences of social isolation and loneliness during shelter-inplace orders and 2) unmet health needs related to changes in social interactions. Design: Mixed-methods, longitudinal phone-based survey administered every 2 weeks. Setting: Two community sites and an academic geriatrics outpatient clinical practice. Participants: 151 community-dwelling older adults. We measured social isolation using a 6-item modified Duke Social Support Index, social interaction sub-scale, which included assessments of video-based and internetbased socializing. Measures of loneliness included self-reported worsened loneliness due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and loneliness severity based on the 3-item UCLA loneliness scale. Participants were invited to share open-ended comments about their social experiences. Results: Participants were on average 75 years old (SD=10), 50% had hearing or vision impairment, 64% lived alone, and 26% difficulty bathing. Participants reported social isolation in 40% of interviews, 76% reported minimal video-based socializing, and 42% minimal internetbased socializing. Socially isolated participants reported difficulty finding help with functional needs, including bathing (20% versus 55%, p=0.04). Over half (54%) of participants reported worsened loneliness due to COVID-19, which was associated with worsened depression (62% versus 9%, p<0.001) and anxiety (57% versus 9%, p<0.001). Rates of loneliness improved on average by time since shelter-in-place orders (4-6 weeks: 46% versus 13-15 weeks: 27%, p=0.009), however, loneliness persisted or worsened for a subgroup of participants. Open-ended responses revealed challenges faced by the subgroup experiencing persistent loneliness, including poor emotional coping and discomfort with new technologies. Many older adults are adjusting to COVID-19 restrictions since the start of shelterin-place orders. Additional steps are critically needed to address the psychological suffering and unmet medical needs of those with persistent loneliness or barriers to technology-based social interaction. \",\n\"Social Isolation and Loneliness Among San Francisco Bay Area Older Adults During the COVID-19 Shelter-in-Place Orders[SEP]Background/Objectives: Physical distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic may have unintended, detrimental effects on social isolation and loneliness among older adults.

By means of analytical arguments as well as extensive computer simulations, we demonstrate that the heterogeneity in infection rate can either impede or accelerate the epidemic spreading, which depends on the amount of vaccinated individuals introduced in the population as well as the contact pattern among the individuals. Remarkably, as long as the individuals with different capability of acquiring the disease interact with unequal frequency, there always exist a cross point for the fraction of vaccinated, below which the diversity of infection rate hinders the epidemic spreading and above which expedites it. The overall results are robust to the SVIR dynamics defined on different population models; the possible applications of the results are discussed. \",\n\"Behavior of susceptible-vaccinated-infected-recovered epidemics with diversity in the infection rate of the individuals[SEP]We study a susceptible-vaccinated-infected-recovered (SVIR) epidemic-spreading model with diversity of infection rate of the individuals.

The study applied a text network approach on the bibliometric data of over 400 articles published between December 2019 and December 2020. It was found that the researches and the associated themes were geographically distributed based on the events that took place in the respective countries. Most of the articles were published by the authors from four countries, the USA, China, Japan, and the UK. The text network results revealed that the USA-based studies mainly focused on international travelers, monitoring, travel impacts of COVID-19, and social-distancing measures. The Japanese-based studies focused on the princess diamond cruise ship incident. On the other hand, Chinese authors published articles related to travel to Wuhan and China, passenger health, and public transportation. The UK-based studies had diverse topics of interest. Lastly, the remaining 62 countries' studies focused on returning travelers from China, public transportation, and the global spread of COVID-19.

By analysing 1146 vampire bat-transmitted rabies (VBR) outbreaks in livestock across 12 years in Peru, we demonstrate that viral expansions into historically uninfected zones have doubled the recent burden of VBR. Viral expansions are geographically widespread, but severely constrained by high elevation peaks in the Andes mountains. Within Andean valleys, invasions form wavefronts that are advancing towards large, unvaccinated livestock populations that are heavily bitten by bats, which together will fuel high transmission and mortality. Using spatial models, we forecast the pathways of ongoing VBR epizootics across heterogeneous landscapes. These results directly inform vaccination strategies to mitigate impending viral emergence, reveal VBR as an emerging rather than an enzootic disease and create opportunities to test novel interventions to manage viruses in bat reservoirs. \",\n\"Spatial expansions and travelling waves of rabies in vampire bats[SEP]A major obstacle to anticipating the cross-species transmission of zoonotic diseases and developing novel strategies for their control is the scarcity of data informing how these pathogens circulate within natural reservoir populations.

Caring is recognized as a core competency in nursing; this competency is difficult to cultivate and measure. This study aimed to explore the effect of online team-based learning (TBL) on cultivating nursing students' caring competency. (2) Method: A mix-methods study design with convenience sampling was used for this study. The intervention was online TBL with field observation. Quantitative data were collected by the modified Peer Caring Measurement (PCM) and analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Qualitative data were collected by dialog in social media and analyzed by content analysis. (3) Result: Both the quantitative and qualitative data showed a significant increase in caring competency. A paired t-test of modified PCM showed significant improvement (p < 0.001), and female students had greater learning performances compared with male students in academic and affective dimensions. Three themes emerged, including that online TBL possesses remarkable benefits, students felt in charge of their learning, and changes in the students' caring competency were revealed. (4) Conclusion: This online TBL strategy works well in teaching and fostering caring in an online environment among nursing students, which is necessary under COVID-19 restrictions. \",\n\"Online Team-Based Learning Teaching Strategy for Developing Caring Competencies in Nursing Students under COVID-19 Pandemic Restrictions[SEP]1) Background: The COVID-19 pandemic impacted education systems globally, and numerous strategies were used to transform education into online learning.

Furthermore, low-dose radiation has been found to reduce inflammation and aid the curing of COVID-19. The receptor binding domain (RBD), a recombinant spike protein with a His tag at the C-terminus, binds to ACE2 in human body. We thus constructed a radioiodinated RBD as a molecule-targeted probe to non-invasively explore ACE2 expression in vivo, and to investigate radiotherapy pathway for inhibiting ACE2. RBD was labeled with [ 124 I]NaI using an N-bromosuccinimide (NBS)-mediated method, and 124 I-RBD was obtained after purification with a specific activity of 28.9 GBq/nmol. Its radiochemical purity was (RCP) over 90% in saline for 5 days. The dissociation constant of 124 I-RBD binding to hACE2 was 75.7 nM. The uptake of 124 I-RBD by HeLa ACE+ cells at 2 h was 2.96% \\u00b1 0.35%, which could be substantially blocked by an excessive amount of RBD, and drop to 1.71% \\u00b1 0.23%. In BALB/c mice, the biodistribution of 124 I-RBD after intravenous injection showed a moderate metabolism rate, and its 24 hpost injection (p.i.) organ distribution was similar to the expression profile in body. Micro-PET imaging of mice after intrapulmonary injection showed high uptake of lung at 1, 4, 24 h p.i.. In conclusion, the experimental results demonstrate the potential of 124 I-RBD as a novel targeted molecular probe for COVID-19.

The goal of this work is to develop an approach to improve the method based on historical data for AED placement. To this end, we have developed a riskbased method which generates artificial OHCAs based on a risk model. We compare our risk-based method with the one based on historical data using real Singapore OHCA occurrences from Pan-Asian Resuscitation Outcome Study (PAROS). Results show that to deploy a large number of AEDs the risk-based method outperforms the method purely using historical data on the testing dataset.

Only validated Cepheid results were reported for routine patient care. The results, Cepheid cycle threshold (Ct), and run times were compared to define the relative performance characteristics of the ID NOW (Table 1) . J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof A total of 105 samples were analyzed on both platforms. While all samples run on the Cepheid were valid, 96 samples (91.4%) produced a valid result and 9 (8.57%) were invalid on the ID NOW. The overall positivity rate, as detected by Cepheid, was 20.8% (20/96), while the ID NOW detected just 12.5% (12/96) positive specimens. The overall positive agreement between Cepheid and ID now was 60%. Specimens that were judged to be positive using the ID NOW and Cepheid assay all demonstrated detection of the N2 gene with an average Ct of 31.3 (range: 22.2-41) and 11/12 detected the E2 gene with an average Ct of 28.6 (range: 19.7-39.7). Specimens that were judged to be positive using the Cepheid assay, but negative in the ID NOW assay had N2 gene detected in 8/8 (100%) samples, with an average Ct value of 38.4 (range: 34.1-41.3), and 6/8 (80%) of samples had E gene detected with an average Ct of 33.7 (range: 28.2-37.7). The average time to a positive result on the ID NOW was 2 minutes 28 seconds. The time to all negative results was 10 minutes. These run-times do not include additional loading times or three minutes of sample receiver warm-up. This is in contrast to the Cepheid, where average run time was 53 minutes. In conclusion, in comparison to the Xpert Xpress SARS-CoV-2 test, the Abbott ID NOW COVID-19 assay provides a very fast result, however, the analytical sensitivity of the assay is suboptimal, particularly at lower viral burden corresponding to a high cycle time. Most importantly, the assay is suboptimal even when used in a patient population with a high pre-test probability, i.e. symptomatic ED patients. These results are consistent with recent studies which also found lower positive agreement for the ID NOW, ranging from 54.8%-94%, in comparison to more sensitive molecular platforms [4-8]. Many variables may influence test performance, including specimen type, collection, transport, and handling. However in this study, the dry nasal swabs specimens were collected using ID NOW kit nasal swabs, specimens were collected by health care providers for both platforms, and specimens were stored and run according to the manufacturer's instructions. Despite following the manufacturer's instructions, there was a high rate of invalid results on the ID NOW which is attributed to a certain step in the protocol requiring the user to forcefully push the sample transfer cartridge into the test base until full descent of a J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof test indicator. It was observed that non-forceful pushing without full descent of the test indicator was the common step for some of the invalid results. Per the manufacturer's protocol, one additional test may be run using the same sample. However, since multiple users were running samples for this study, invalid results were not retested consistently. This is another limitation of the ID NOW, as invalid rate can be variable depending on the user's technique. In comparison to other published studies to date, our study directly compared same specimen type (paired nasal swabs), eliminating many confounding factors. ID NOW could be beneficial when used in a setting of high community transmission where the viral burden is high with low Ct value. However, a negative result should prompt retesting on a different molecular platform due to the assay's suboptimal sensitivity at low viral burden. Retesting may expend scarce resources, particularly due to the need for dual sample collection (dry swab for ID NOW and swab in VTM for other molecular assays), subject the patient to unnecessary stress, and prolong time to result. Both patients and health care professionals should be aware of the limitations of the Abbott ID NOW COVID-19 assay.

Oncological patients are the most affected populations since these days. Because of decreasing numbers in surgery and endoscopy, gastric cancer patients had difficulties in treatment and diagnoses. Therefore, the early and long-term results may be affected during the pandemic. In this study, we aimed to evaluate pandemia effects on gastric cancer surgery in a single center. Patients-Methods Patients were categorized as the COVID group and the Pre-COVID group. Patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy were excluded from the study. In the COVID period, 50 patients underwent gastric cancer surgery, while 64 were operated on in the pre-COVID period. Patients' demographics and clinical and pathological outcomes were evaluated. Results There was no statistically significant difference in both periods among patient characteristics such as age, gender, and body mass index. Pre-operative laboratory results were similar between two groups. Although there was no difference in operation types, an increase was detected in Clavien-Dindo grade 3 and higher complications during the COVID period. During the pandemic, there was a significant difference in the pathological outcomes. Peritoneal cytology-positive patients were h\\u0131gher in the COVID group. More lymphovascular invasions were also detected in the COVID period. Finally, it resulted stage differences between two groups. Conclusion Because of COVID-19's heavy burden on healthcare system, delays in the diagnosis and treatment of oncological patients may occur.

In the COVID period, 50 patients underwent gastric cancer surgery, while 64 were operated on in the pre-COVID period. Patients' demographics and clinical and pathological outcomes were evaluated. Results There was no statistically significant difference in both periods among patient characteristics such as age, gender, and body mass index. Pre-operative laboratory results were similar between two groups. Although there was no difference in operation types, an increase was detected in Clavien-Dindo grade 3 and higher complications during the COVID period. During the pandemic, there was a significant difference in the pathological outcomes. Peritoneal cytology-positive patients were h\\u0131gher in the COVID group. More lymphovascular invasions were also detected in the COVID period. Finally, it resulted stage differences between two groups. Conclusion Because of COVID-19's heavy burden on healthcare system, delays in the diagnosis and treatment of oncological patients may occur. Therefore, this may be affected pathological and survival outcomes of cancer patients. Finally, further investigations are needed. \"],\n [\"Design and Optimization of ECG Modeling for Generating Different Cardiac Dysrhythmias\",\n\"Citation: Awal, M..A.; Mostafa, S.S.; Ahmad, M.; Alahe, M.A.; Rashid, M.A.; Kouzani, A.Z.; Mahmud, M.A.P.

This work aimed to define the dynamics of humoral and cell-mediated immune response in a cohort of health care workers (HCWs) who received a two-dose BNT162b2-mRNA vaccination. The serological response was evaluated by quantifying the anti-RBD and neutralizing antibodies. The cell-mediated response was performed by a whole blood test quantifying Th1 cytokines (IFN-\\u03b3, TNF-\\u03b1, IL-2), produced in response to spike peptides. The BNT162b2-mRNA vaccine induced both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses against spike peptides in virtually all HCWs without previous SARS-CoV-2 infection, with a moderate inverse relation with age in the anti-RBD response. Spike-specific T cells produced several Th1 cytokines (IFN-\\u03b3, TNF-\\u03b1, and IL-2), which correlated with the specific-serological response. Overall, our study describes the ability of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine to elicit a coordinated neutralizing humoral and spike-specific T cell response in HCWs.

One of the major concerns regarding to IB is the emergence of new types of infectious bronchitis viruses (IBVs). The purpose of this study was to identify the IBVs isolated from Iranian broiler chickens with respiratory symptoms. Twenty-five broiler flocks around Ahwaz (southwest of Iran) were examined for IBV. The specimens including trachea, lung, liver, kidney, and ceacal tonsil, were collected from diseased birds and inoculated into chicken embryonated eggs. Harvested allantoic fluids were subjected to reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using primers in order to amplify spike 1 (S1) gene of IBV. The RT-PCR products of four IBV isolates were sequenced. The results showed that from 25 examined flocks with respiratory disease, 12 flocks (48.00%) were positive for IBV. In phylogenetic analysis, our isolates were closely related to the QX-like viruses such as PCRLab/06/2012 (Iran), QX, HC9, HC10, CK/CH/GX/NN11-1, CK/CH/JS/YC11-1, CK/CH/JS/2010/13, CK/CH/JS/2011/2 (China), QX/SGK-21, QX/SGK-11 (Iraq) with nucleotide homology up to 99.00%. This study indicates the role of IBVs in the respiratory disorders of broiler flocks located in southwest Iran, and also the existence of a variant of IBV, which is distinguishable from the other Iranian variants. \",\n\"Molecular detection and phylogenetic properties of isolated infectious bronchitis viruses from broilers in Ahvaz, southwest Iran, based on partial sequences of spike gene[SEP]Infectious bronchitis (IB) is a highly contagious disease involving mostly upper respiratory tract in chickens, leading to significant economic losses in the poultry industry worldwide.

Quantitative research is still needed however to assess the efficacy of different candidate NPIs and their timings to guide ongoing and future responses to epidemics of this emerging disease across the World. We built a travel network-based susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) model to simulate the outbreak across cities in mainland China. We used epidemiological parameters estimated for the early stage of outbreak in Wuhan to parameterise the transmission before NPIs were implemented. To quantify the relative effect of various NPIs, daily changes of delay from illness onset to the first reported case in each county were used as a proxy for the improvement of case identification and isolation across the outbreak. Historical and near-real time human movement data, obtained from Baidu location-based service, were used to derive the intensity of travel restrictions and contact reductions across China. The model and outputs were validated using daily reported case numbers, with a series of sensitivity analyses conducted. We estimated that there were a total of 114,325 COVID-19 cases (interquartile range [IQR] 76,776 -164,576) in mainland China as of February 29, 2020, and these were highly correlated (p<0.001, R 2 =0.86) with reported incidence. Without NPIs, the number of COVID-19 cases would likely have shown a 67-fold increase (IQR: 44 -94), with the effectiveness of different interventions varying. The early detection and isolation of cases was estimated to prevent more infections than travel restrictions and contact reductions, but integrated NPIs would achieve the strongest and most rapid effect. If NPIs could have been conducted one week, two weeks, or three weeks earlier in China, cases could have been reduced by 66%, 86%, and 95%, respectively, together with significantly reducing the number of affected areas.

This study aimed to investigate the diversity of rice accessions grown in the region to build a breeding program. Methods and results A total of 62 accessions of rice from farmers and research stations were collected from the Kurdistan region, including short-grain and long-grain types, for molecular genetics and diversity analysis. In this study, 37 polymorphic simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were selected with several molecular genetics software programs. The results show that these SSR markers are very effective for this investigation, generating a total of 152 observed alleles (Na), 75.166 Effective number of alleles (Ne) and an average of 4.1 and 2.03 alleles per locus, respectively.

The research presented here confirms two subpopulations, japonica (C1 and C2) and indica (C3), based on molecular genetics data analysis. Analysis of molecular variance revealed that the 72% variance was due to the variation among populations and 28% within the population. Conclusions Altogether, these results indicate that there is very low gene flow.

This study aimed to investigate the diversity of rice accessions grown in the region to build a breeding program. Methods and results A total of 62 accessions of rice from farmers and research stations were collected from the Kurdistan region, including short-grain and long-grain types, for molecular genetics and diversity analysis. In this study, 37 polymorphic simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers were selected with several molecular genetics software programs. The results show that these SSR markers are very effective for this investigation, generating a total of 152 observed alleles (Na), 75.166 Effective number of alleles (Ne) and an average of 4.1 and 2.03 alleles per locus, respectively. The average polymorphic information content (PIC) per locus was recorded as 0.404. The research presented here confirms two subpopulations, japonica (C1 and C2) and indica (C3), based on molecular genetics data analysis.

Global distribution and propagation of BCG has contributed to the in vitro evolution of the vaccine strain and is thought to partially account for the different outcomes of BCG vaccine trials. Previous efforts by several molecular techniques effectively identified large sequence polymorphisms among BCG daughter strains, but lacked the resolution to identify smaller changes. In this study, we have used a NimbleGen tiling array for whole genome comparison of 13 BCG strains. Using this approach, in tandem with DNA resequencing, we have identified six novel large sequence polymorphisms including four deletions and two duplications in specific BCG strains. Moreover, we have uncovered various polymorphisms in the phoP-phoR locus. Importantly, these polymorphisms affect genes encoding established virulence factors including cell wall complex lipids, ESX secretion systems, and the PhoP-PhoR two-component system. Our study demonstrates that major virulence factors are different among BCG strains, which provide molecular mechanisms for important vaccine phenotypes including adverse effect profile, tuberculin reactivity and protective efficacy. These findings have important implications for the development of a new generation of vaccines. \",\n\"BMC Genomics Novel genome polymorphisms in BCG vaccine strains and impact on efficacy[SEP]Bacille Calmette-Gu\\u00e9rin (BCG) is an attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis currently used as a vaccine against tuberculosis.

Therapeutics that may assist to contain its rapid spread and reduce its high mortality rates are urgently needed. Developing vaccines against the SARS-CoV-2 virus may take many months. Moreover, vaccines based on viral-encoded peptides may not be effective against future coronavirus epidemics, as virus mutations could make them futile. Indeed, new Influenza virus strains emerge every year, requiring new immunizations. A tentative suggestion based on existing therapeutics, which would likely be resistant to new coronavirus mutations, is to use available angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1R) blockers, such as losartan, as therapeutics for reducing the aggressiveness and mortality from SARS-CoV-2 virus infections. This idea is based on observations that the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) very likely serves as the binding site for SARS-CoV-2, the strain implicated in the current COVID-19 epidemic, similarly to strain SARS-CoV implicated in the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic. This commentary elaborates on the idea of considering AT1R blockers as tentative treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infections, and proposes a research direction based on datamining of clinical patient records for assessing its feasibility. \",\n\"Angiotensin receptor blockers as tentative SARS-CoV-2 therapeutics[SEP]At the time of writing this commentary (February 2020), the coronavirus COVID-19 epidemic has already resulted in more fatalities compared with the SARS and MERS coronavirus epidemics combined.

It has been recently suggested that SARS-Cov-2-associated ARDS may differ from usual non-SARS-Cov-2-associated ARDS by higher respiratory system compliance (C RS ), lower potential for recruitment with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) contrasting with severe shunt fraction. The purpose of the study was to systematically assess respiratory mechanics and recruitability in SARS-Cov-2-associated ARDS. Gas exchanges, C RS and hemodynamics were assessed at 2 levels of PEEP (15 cmH 2 O and 5 cmH 2 O) within 36 h (day1) and from 4 to 6 days (day 5) after intubation. The recruited volume was computed as the difference between the volume expired from PEEP 15 to 5 cmH 2 O and the volume predicted by compliance at PEEP 5 cmH 2 O (or above airway opening pressure). The recruitment-to-inflation (R/I) ratio (i.e. the ratio between the recruited lung compliance and C RS at PEEP 5 cmH 2 O) was used to assess lung recruitability. A R/I ratio value higher than or equal to 0.5 was used to define highly recruitable patients. The R/I ratio was calculated in 25 of the 26 enrolled patients at day 1 and in 15 patients at day 5. At day 1, 16 (64%) were considered as highly recruitable (R/I ratio median [interquartile range] 0.7 [0.55-0.94]) and 9 (36%) were considered as poorly recruitable (R/I ratio 0.41 [0.31-0.48]). The PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio at PEEP 15 cmH 2 O was higher compared to PEEP 5 cmH 2 O only in highly recruitable patients (173 [139-236] vs 135 [89-167] mmHg; p < 0.01). Neither PaO 2 /FiO 2 or C RS measured at PEEP 15 cmH 2 O or at PEEP 5 cmH 2 O nor changes in PaO 2 /FiO 2 or C RS in response to PEEP changes allowed to identify highly or poorly recruitable patients. In this series of 25 patients with SARS-Cov-2 associated ARDS, 64% were considered as highly recruitable and only 36% as poorly recruitable based on the R/I ratio performed on the day of intubation. This observation suggests that a systematic R/I ratio assessment may help to guide initial PEEP titration to limit harmful effect of unnecessary high PEEP in the context of Covid-19 crisis. \",\n\"Recruitability and effect of PEEP in SARS-Cov-2-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome[SEP]Background: A large proportion of patients with a SARS-Cov-2-associated respiratory failure develop an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

For operation recognition, instead of directly building and training a deep learning model from scratch, which needs a huge amount of data, transfer learning is applied to transfer the learning abilities to our application. A worker assembly operation dataset is established, which at present contains 10 sequential operations in an assembly task of installing a desktop CNC machine. The developed transfer learning model is evaluated on this dataset and achieves a recognition accuracy of 95% in the testing experiments. \"],\n [\"What incentives increase data sharing in health and medical research? A systematic review\",\n\"Background: The foundation of health and medical research is data. Data sharing facilitates the progress of research and strengthens science. Data sharing in research is widely discussed in the literature; however, there are seemingly no evidence-based incentives that promote data sharing. Methods: A systematic review (registration: doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/6PZ5E) of the health and medical research literature was used to uncover any evidence-based incentives, with pre-and post-empirical data that examined data sharing rates. We were also interested in quantifying and classifying the number of opinion pieces on the importance of incentives, the number observational studies that analysed data sharing rates and practices, and strategies aimed at increasing data sharing rates. Results: Only one incentive (using open data badges) has been tested in health and medical research that examined data sharing rates. The number of opinion pieces (n = 85) out-weighed the number of article-testing strategies (n = 76), and the number of observational studies exceeded them both (n = 106). Conclusions: Given that data is the foundation of evidence-based health and medical research, it is paradoxical that there is only one evidence-based incentive to promote data sharing. More well-designed studies are needed in order to increase the currently low rates of data sharing. Despite the current shift towards more open data in health and medical research, there are seemingly no evidence-based incentives that increase data sharing. As such, a systematic review was used to verify the lack of evidence-based incentives in this area. This study aims to systematically review the literature to appraise and synthesise scientific research papers that concern incentives that have been tested to increase data sharing in health and medical research. \",\n\"What incentives increase data sharing in health and medical research?

The present physician-based European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) survey aimed to assess the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on RM of CIEDs among EHRA members and how it changed the current practice. The survey comprised 27 questions focusing on RM use before and during the pandemic. Questions focused on the impact of COVID-19 on the frequency of in-office visits, data filtering, reasons for initiating in-person visits, underutilization of RM during COVID-19, and RM reimbursement. A total of 160 participants from 28 countries completed the survey. Compared to the pre-pandemic period, there was a significant increase in the use of RM in patients with pacemakers (PMs) and implantable loop recorders (ILRs) during the COVID-19 pandemic (PM 24.2 vs. 39.9%, P = 0.002; ILRs 61.5 vs. 73.5%, P = 0.028), while there was a trend towards higher utilization of RM for cardiac resynchronization therapy-pacemaker (CRT-P) devices during the pandemic (44.5 vs. 55%, P = 0.063). The use of RM with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) and CRTdefibrillator (CRT-D) did not significantly change during the pandemic (ICD 65.2 vs. 69.6%, P = 0.408; CRT-D 65.2 vs. 68.8%, P = 0.513). The frequency of in-office visits was significantly lower during the pandemic (P < 0.001). Nearly two-thirds of participants (57 out of 87 respondents), established new RM connections for CIEDs implanted before the pandemic with 33.3% (n = 29) delivering RM transmitters to the patient's home address, and the remaining 32.1% (n = 28) activating RM connections during an in-office visit. The results of this survey suggest that the crisis caused by COVID-19 has led to a significant increase in the use of RM of CIEDs. \",\n\"The use of remote monitoring of cardiac implantable devices during the COVID-19 pandemic: an EHRA physician survey[SEP]It is unclear to what extent the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced the use of remote monitoring (RM) of cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs).

Image-based stratification of patient dose could improve tumour sensitivity to RT. Tumours are associated with high cellularity and chaotic and hyperpermeable microvasculature; our hypothesis is that super-resolution ultrasound (SRUS) 1 combined with dynamic-contrast enhanced and diffusion-weighted MRI (DCE/DW-MRI) will enable unprecedented quantification of tumour microvessel dynamics and detection of early resistance/relapse. 6 patients with locally advanced breast cancer underwent bilateral breast MR-imaging pre-and 2w post-RT as part of a clinical trial assessing the effectiveness of intra-tumoral H 2 O 2 injections as a radiosensitiser. 3/6 patient also received a follow-up scan 6 m post-RT (study ongoing). Axial DW-and 3D isotropic DCE-MRI were acquired using 14 b values from 0 to 1200 s/mm 2 and variable flip angle acquisition (3\\u00b0and 16\\u00b0) respectively. Contrast injection was performed with a power injector (Dotarem, 0.1 mmol/kg at rate 3 ml/ s), with post-contrast dynamic images acquired at 16\\u00b0only. A temporal resolution of 12.2 s is achieved using TWIST view-sharing (central region 33%, sampling density 33%), to quantify contrast dynamics while maintaining high spatial resolution to capture intratumoral heterogeneity. Changes in T1 calculated using a variable flipangle model 2 are converted into contrast concentration values. Tumour volumes of interest were delineated and approved by a consultant radiologist, from which mean ADC (apparent diffusion coefficient) values were calculated, alongside mean AUC90 (area under curve for first 90 s) from DCE-MRI uptake curves. SRUS maps of the tumour microvasculature were generated from high frame-rate contrast enhanced (Sonovue contrast agent) US acquisitions at the same time-points. Preliminary analysis confirmed that breast tumour microvasculature can be imaged using SRUS with remarkable clarity, and changes in microvascular structure can be visually detected post-RT ( Fig. 1) . There was an increase in mean ADC after RT for all patients apart from one (p value = 0.04; Fig. 2 ). After 6 m, ADC measurements remained elevated. Mean AUC90 values showed no significant change post-RT across the small population (p value = 0.23; Fig. 3 ), but individual effects may be visible upon further interogation. Figure 1 (SRUS) and 3 (ADC) is patient 3 pre-and 2w post-RT. Initial pilot data shows that radiation induced changes can be detected by MRI/SRUS as early as 2w post-RT. Future analysis will include investigation of intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) modelling 3 and correlating quantitative measurements from SRUS and MRI, to provide early response/resistance biomarkers for RT. Introduction: Despite physical and technical challenges associated with thoracic MRI, several imaging techniques such as ultra-short echo time or balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) have shown promising results for the assessment of both lung morphology and function (1, 2). Only recently, bSTAR imaging was introduced for morphological chest imaging at 1.5 T (3, 4) . The technique is based on a half-radial dual-echo balanced steady-state free precession kernel using an interleaved Archimedean spiral k-space trajectory and allows for single breath-hold or free-breathing chest scans. In this work we assess bSTAR imaging on a commercially available lowcost 0.55 T clinical MR scanner and test its feasibility in a group of healthy volunteers. Methods: Experiments were performed on a 0.55 T whole-body MRscanner (MAGNETOM Free.Max, Siemens Healthineers) using a 6-channel chest array coil and a 6-channel spine coil. Five healthy volunteers were scanned using breath-hold and free-breathing bSTAR. All scans were performed with: TE1/TE2/TR = 0.08/2.1/ 2.2 ms, field-of-view = 34 9 34 9 34 cm 3 , 100 us hard RF pulse, flip angle a = 25\\u00b0, bandwidth = 1002 Hz/pixel yielding 1.3 mm isotropic resolution. Breath-hold scans (BH-bSTAR) were performed in 23 s using 10,000 half-projections and 4 interleaves, while the free-breathing scans (FB-bSTAR) were acquired in 5:30 min using 150,000 half-projections and 300 spiral interleaves. BH-bSTAR and FB-bSTAR images were reconstructed using FISTA algorithm (5). Retrospective respiratory gating was used to extract data acquired at the end-expiratory phase of the respiratory cycle. For comparison, BH-bSTAR acquisitions were performed at 1.5 T (MAGNETOM AvantoFit, Siemens Heathineers) as described in (3). Results: Figure 1 shows exemplary chest images in axial and coronal projections acquired using BH-bSTAR and FB-bSTAR in healthy subjects. Furthermore, maximum intensity projection images were generated for improved visualization of the vasculature. A comparison between BH-bSTAR scans performed at 0.55 T and 1.5 T is shown in Fig. 2 . Discussion: In the recent years, low-field MR systems have regained popularity due to improved hardware, signal post-processing quality and significantly reduced running costs as compared to standard 1.5-3 T MR systems. In this work we have shown that for lung MRI a similar image quality can be achieved on a low-cost commercially available 0.55 T clinical system with limited gradient specifications as compared to a high-end 1.5 T MR-system. In conclusion, we have demonstrated excellent prospects for clinical lung imaging using 3D bSTAR in a group of healthy volunteers at 0.55 T.

The second objective was to seek a statically significant cut-off value for NLR and PLR that could suggest COVID-19.

A central challenge is sensitivity of predictions to input parameters coupled with uncertainty about these parameters. Nearly 2 y into the pandemic, parameter uncertainty remains because of changes in vaccination efficacy, viral variants, and mask mandates, and because universities' unique characteristics hinder translation from the general population: a high fraction of young people, who have higher rates of asymptomatic infection and social contact, as well as an enhanced ability to implement behavioral and testing interventions.

A central challenge is sensitivity of predictions to input parameters coupled with uncertainty about these parameters. Nearly 2 y into the pandemic, parameter uncertainty remains because of changes in vaccination efficacy, viral variants, and mask mandates, and because universities' unique characteristics hinder translation from the general population: a high fraction of young people, who have higher rates of asymptomatic infection and social contact, as well as an enhanced ability to implement behavioral and testing interventions.

Thus, we aimed to develop a rapid viability RT-qPCR procedure to infer SARS-CoV-25 2 infectivity in clinical specimens and environmental samples. Methods: We screened 26 monoazide dyes and platinum compounds as viability molecular markers on five SARS-CoV-2 27 RNA targets. A platinum chloride-based viability RT-qPCR was then optimized using genomic 28 RNA, and inactivated SARS-CoV-2 particles inoculated in buffer, stool, and urine. Our results 29 were finally validated in nasopharyngeal swabs from persons who tested positive for COVID-19 30 and in wastewater samples positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Findings: We established a rapid 31 viability RT-qPCR that selectively detects potentially infectious SARS-CoV-2 particles in complex 32 matrices. In particular, the confirmed positivity of nasopharyngeal swabs following the viability 33 procedure suggests their potential infectivity, while the complete prevention of amplification in 34 wastewater indicated either non-infectious particles or free RNA. Interpretation: The viability 35 RT-qPCR approach provides a more accurate ascertainment of the infectious viruses detection 36 and it may complement analyses to foster risk-based investigations for the prevention and 37 control of new or re-occurring outbreaks with a broad application spectrum. \",\n\"Viability RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2: a step forward to solve the infectivity quandary 1 2[SEP]not discerned.

Clinically, it is mostly used to measure glomerular filtration rate as a marker for kidney function due to its relatively small molecular weight and easy detection. However, recent findings suggest that Cst C is regulated at both transcriptional and post-translational levels, and Cst C production from haematopoietic cell lineages contributes significantly to the systematic pools of Cst C. Furthermore, Cst C is directly linked to many pathologic processes through various mechanisms. Thus fluctuation of Cst C levels might have serious clinical implications rather than a mere reflection of kidney functions. Here, we summarize the pathophysiological roles of Cst C dependent and independent on its inhibition of proteases, outline its change of expression by various stimuli, and elucidate the regulatory mechanisms to control this disease-related protease inhibitor.

These are challenging injuries and the standard treatment is surgical repair under general or regional anaesthesia. 'Wide-awake' surgery is an emerging technique in hand surgery where a conscious patient is operated on under local anaesthetic. The vasoconstrictive effect of adrenaline (epinephrine) creates a 'bloodless' operating field and a tourniquet is not required. The potential advantages include intra-operative testing of the repair; removal of the risks of general anaesthesia; reduced costs; no aerosol generation from intubation therefore reduced risk of COVID-19 spread to healthcare professionals. The aim of this study will be to systematically evaluate the evidence to determine if wide-awake surgery is superior to general/regional anaesthetic in adults who undergo flexor tendon repair. Methods: We designed and registered a study protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis of comparative and non-comparative studies. The primary outcome will be functional active range of motion. Secondary outcomes will be complications, resource use (operative time) and patient-reported outcome measures. A comprehensive literature search will be conducted (from 1946 to present) in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library. Grey literature will be identified through Open Grey, dissertation databases and clinical trials registers. All studies on wide-awake surgery for flexor tendon repair will be included. The comparator will be general or regional anaesthesia. No limitations will be imposed on peer review status or language of publication. Two investigators will independently screen all citations, full-text articles and abstract data. Potential conflicts will be resolved through discussion or referral to a third author when necessary. The study methodological quality (or bias) will be appraised using an appropriate tool. If feasible, we will conduct a random effects meta-analysis.

In this paper, a different approach has been discussed, which is the development of predictive models for the SEIRD variables that have been based on the historical data collected, and the context variables to where this model has been applied to. Particularly, the context variables examined in this paper include total population, number of people over 65 years old, poverty index, morbidity rates, average age, and population density. For the construction of the SEIRD predictive models, this study encompasses a deep analysis of the dependence of these variables and also, their relationship with the context variables. Hence, before the development of predictive models using machine learning techniques, a methodology to analyze the interdependence of the SEIRD variables has been proposed. The dependence with the context variables is also discussed; to avoid the curse of dimensionality and multicollinearity problems, leading to better results and the reduction of the computational cost. Finally, several prediction models based on varied machine learning techniques and inputs are considered, these include temporal interdependence, temporal intra-dependence, and dependence with context variables. Each of the predictive models has been studied, as well as their quality of prediction. This paper focuses on the analysis of the quality of this approach, applied in Colombia, obtaining the results about the performance of the predictive models for the SEIRD variables. The results are very encouraging since the values obtained with the quality metrics are quite good for different prediction horizons. \",\n\"Machine learning models for the prediction of the SEIRD variables for the COVID-19 pandemic based on a deep dependence analysis of variables[SEP]The SEIRD (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered, and Dead) model is a mathematical model based on dynamic equations; widely used for characterization of the COVID-19 pandemic.

It enters by binding with ACE2 receptor present on the outer surface of a cell by cleaving S1/S2 with proteolytic protein Furin. Further viral replication or transcription then takes place with the help of main protease 3CLpro and polymerase RdRp. This in silco study was carried out to block ACE2, Furin, 3CLpro and RdRP with various phytochemicals to prevent SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication or transcription. Twenty different phytochemicals were screened to understand the drug-likeliness obeying Lipinski's rule 5 and further, molecular docking was performed using these phytochemicals to block their respective target proteins. All the phytochemicals follow Lipinski's rule of five and molecular docking result shows best binding affinity of Podofilox -7.54 kcal/mol with ACE2, Psoralidin -8.04 kcal/mol with Furin, Ursolic acid -8.88 kcal/mol with 3CLpro and Epiafzelechin -8.26 kcal/mol with RdRp. Thus, blocking two human receptors ACE2 and Furin with Podofilox and Psoralidin respectively may prevent the viral entry into the cells. Also blocking viral proteins 3CLpro and RdRp with Ursolic acid and Epiafzelechin may prevent viral replication or transcription. Using this combination therapy of blocking the receptors responsible for viral entry and viral proteins responsible for replication or transcription may prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection. \",\n\"Potential combination therapy using twenty phytochemicals from twenty plants to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection: An in silico Approach[SEP]Covid 19 caused by novel strain SARS-CoV-2 has become a pandemic due to its contagious nature of infection.

To reduce the burden for the patients, video consultation can be an alternative to traditional in-person hospital consultations. The aim of the current study was, from the perspectives of patients and health care providers, to investigate the perceived benefits and challenges of using video consultations in outpatient renal transplant recipient follow-up. Methods: Patients (i.e., renal transplant recipients; n = 18) alternated between regular in-person follow-up consultations and video consultations. Patients and health care providers were then invited to participate in semi-structured interviews. The interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: Patients interviewed (n = 15) were median 53 years old (range 37-64) and 53% female. The video consultation solution used in the study turned out to have major technical deficiencies. Despite the technical challenges, however, the majority of the patients reported appreciating being able to alternate between video and in-person hospital consultations. Main benefits reported included not needing to travel to the hospital and thereby saving time, less focus on being chronically ill and potential economic benefits for patients and society. The health care providers (n = 3) also valued the benefits provided by the use of video consultations, but described the reoccurring technical challenges as disruptive. The fact that patients were in a stable phase of their health condition and already had an established, trusting relationship with their nephrologist, acted as facilitators for success. Possible challenges and harms described included concerns related to security, confidentiality and interruptions, as well as the potential need for physical examinations. Conclusions: Benefits from using video consultations as an alternative to in-person consultations may outweigh potential technological challenges for patients as well as health care providers. A long-lasting mutually trusting relationship between patient and provider may be an important prerequisite for the experienced benefits of using video consultation. Findings also indicate that starting such care delivery changes in a small-scale, with a few selected patients in a stable phase of their condition, may be an important factor for success. \",\n\"Video as an alternative to in-person consultations in outpatient renal transplant recipient follow-up: a qualitative study[SEP]Background: Renal transplant recipients have to see a nephrologist for regular follow-up for the rest of their lives.

The research questions were: (1) What employment effects do PWD experience, and what business changes do employers encounter as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic? (2) What challenges have PWD encountered during the pandemic?Methods Cross-sectional online surveys of 733 PWD and 67 employers in the Midwestern United States.Results Compared to non-disabled peers, PWD encountered more challenges in employment during the pandemic. We found high percentages of both employers and PWD experiencing employment changes and business shutdown during the pandemic. For PWD whose employment was not affected, 14.6% of the participants (n = 107) expected a loss of income and worried about the economic uncertainty of the pandemic. Unemployment for PWD is high due to illness or disability, being laid-off or furloughed, business reductions, and not feeling safe to work. However, only about 18.6% of unemployed PWD (n = 16) received pay or benefits for the time they were not working even though more than half filed for unemployment benefits.Conclusions The pandemic adversely affected employment of PWD as reported by workers and employers.

It has also increased our understanding of the immune system, providing evidence for the preferential selection of BCRs to particular (immunodominant) epitopes post vaccination/infection. These important implications for both drug discovery and immunology mean that it is essential to consider the optimal way to combine experimental and computational technology when probing BCR repertoires for convergence signatures. Here, we discuss the theoretical basis for observing BCR repertoire functional convergence and explore factors of study design that can impact functional signal.

Finally, we suggest future areas of development that should increase the power of BCR repertoire functional clustering. ARTICLE HISTORY \",\n\"Current strategies for detecting functional convergence across B-cell receptor repertoires[SEP]Convergence across B-cell receptor (BCR) and antibody repertoires has become instrumental in prioritizing candidates in recent rapid therapeutic antibody discovery campaigns. It has also increased our understanding of the immune system, providing evidence for the preferential selection of BCRs to particular (immunodominant) epitopes post vaccination/infection. These important implications for both drug discovery and immunology mean that it is essential to consider the optimal way to combine experimental and computational technology when probing BCR repertoires for convergence signatures. Here, we discuss the theoretical basis for observing BCR repertoire functional convergence and explore factors of study design that can impact functional signal. We also review the computational arsenal available to detect antibodies with similar functional properties, highlighting opportunities enabled by recent clustering algorithms that exploit structural similarities between BCRs. Finally, we suggest future areas of development that should increase the power of BCR repertoire functional clustering.

To date, only post-mortem techniques such as perfused computed tomography scanning or optical microscopy of cleared tissues achieve cellular resolution across entire organs and imaging methods with equal performance in living mammalian organs have yet to be developed. Recently, 2D ultrasound localization microscopy has successfully mapped the fine-scale vasculature of various organs down to a 10 precision. However, reprojection issues and out-of-plane motion prevent complex blood flow quantification and fast volumetric imaging of whole organs. Here, we demonstrate for the first time in vivo volumetric ultrasound localization microscopy mapping of the rodent brain vasculature. We developed a complete methodological pipeline that includes specific surgery, a dedicated 3D ultrasound acquisition sequence, localization and tracking algorithms, motion correction and realignment, as well as the postprocessing quantification of cerebral blood flow. We illustrate the power of this approach, by mapping the whole rat brain vasculature at a resolution of 12 , revealing mesoscopic to macroscopic vascular architectures and cerebral blood flows ranging from 1 to 100 / . Our results pave the way to the investigation of in vivo vascular processes across the mammalian brain in health and disease, in a wide range of contexts and models. \",\n\"Volumetric ultrasound localization microscopy of the whole brain microvasculature[SEP]Technologies to visualize whole organs across scales in vivo are essential for our understanding of biology in health and disease.

The purpose of the present study was to identify specific profiles of pandemicrelated experiences and their relation to psychosocial functioning using the 92-item Epidemic-Pandemic Impacts Inventory (EPII). Data were collected as part of a crosssectional, online survey of adults (18+) residing in the Northeast region of the United States (N = 652) and recruited via online advertisements. Person-centered latent class analysis (LCA) was applied to 38 pandemic-related experiences that showed a significant bivariate correlation with perceived stress. Measures of psychosocial risk were also obtained. Results revealed five unique profiles of respondents based on patterns of pandemic-related experiences. Three profiles representing about 64% of the sample were characterized by moderate to high exposure to adverse experiences during the pandemic and were more likely to screen positive for depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress. These profiles were differentiated by sociodemographic differences, including age, caregiving, and employment status. Two profiles differentiated by age and caregiver status represented about 36% of the sample and were characterized by relatively low exposure to adverse experiences and lower risk for psychosocial impairment. Findings support the EPII as an instrument for measuring tangible and meaningful experiences in the context of an unprecedented pandemic disaster. This research may serve to identify high-risk subpopulations toward developing public health strategies for supporting families and communities in the context of public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic. \",\n\"Profiling COVID-related experiences in the United States with the Epidemic-Pandemic Impacts Inventory: Linkages to psychosocial functioning[SEP]The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on the lives of individuals, families, and communities around the world with constraints on multiple aspects of daily life.

These particles are classified as ichnovirus virions and resemble ascovirus virions, which are also transmitted by parasitic wasps and attack caterpillars. Ascoviruses replicate DNA and produce virions. Polydnavirus DNA consists of wasp DNA replicated by the wasp from its genome, which also directs particle synthesis. Structural similarities between ascovirus and ichnovirus particles and the biology of their transmission suggest that ichnoviruses evolved from ascoviruses, although molecular evidence for this hypothesis is lacking. Here we show that a family of unique pox-D5 NTPase proteins in the Glypta fumiferanae ichnovirus are related to three Diadromus pulchellus ascovirus proteins encoded by ORFs 90, 91 and 93. A new alignment technique also shows that two proteins from a related ichnovirus are orthologs of other ascovirus virion proteins. Our results provide molecular evidence supporting the origin of ichnoviruses from ascoviruses by lateral transfer of ascoviral genes into ichneumonid wasp genomes, perhaps the first example of symbiogenesis between large DNA viruses and eukaryotic organisms. We also discuss the limits of this evidence through complementary studies, which revealed that passive lateral transfer of viral genes among polydnaviral, bacterial, and wasp genomes may have occurred repeatedly through an intimate coupling of both recombination and replication of viral genomes during evolution. The impact of passive lateral transfers on evolutionary relationships between polydnaviruses and viruses with large double-stranded genomes is considered in the context of the theory of symbiogenesis.

Purpose: Identifying the factors influencing the preventive practices of the healthcare workers (HCWs) is crucial during the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 because the HCWs are exposed to unparalleled levels of risks. Such concern is starting to be explored worldwide although there is only a single study available in Bangladesh with a limited scope of explorations of the domain. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the factors determining better preventive practices of HCWs toward COVID-19. A cross-sectional one-to-one survey was carried out using a validated questionnaire from December 15, 2020 to March 15, 2021 among a sample of 640 HCWs from Khulna, a southwestern division of Bangladesh, consisting of ten districts. The measures included socio-demographics, knowledge, attitude, and preventive practices related information. A binary logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify factors determining preventive practices of HCWs toward COVID-19. Results: More than half of the respondents (62%) were following better preventive practices. Besides, around 70% of them had better knowledge and attitudes toward the disease. Regression analysis showed a number of major determining factors of the HCWs' better preventive practices including being a nurse or other professionals (ie, radiologists and pathologists), being graduates, working in coronavirus isolation units, managing COVID-19 patients, having previous training, and having better attitudes toward COVID-19. The findings confirmed that the HCWs were generally practicing preventive manners although these trends followed were not at the standard level. So, providing guidance and information from authentic sources and organizing proper training could possibly enhance the preventive behavior in managing COVID-19 patients. \",\n\"Factors determining preventive practices of the healthcare workers regarding COVID-19 in Bangladesh[SEP]No external or intramural funding was received.

In addition, how age modulates SARS-CoV-2 re-infection and vaccine breakthrough infections remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigated age-associated SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis, immune responses, and the occurrence of re-infection and vaccine breakthrough infection utilizing a wild-type C57BL/6N mouse model. We demonstrated that interferon and adaptive antibody response upon SARS-CoV-2 challenge are significantly impaired in aged mice compared to young mice, which results in more effective virus replications and severe disease manifestations in the respiratory tract. Aged mice also showed increased susceptibility to re-infection due to insufficient immune protection acquired during the primary infection. Importantly, two-dose COVID-19 mRNA vaccination conferred limited adaptive immune response among the aged mice, making them susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Collectively, our findings call for tailored and optimized treatments and prevention strategies against SARS-CoV-2 among older individuals. \",\n\"Age-associated SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infection and changes in immune response in a mouse model[SEP]Older individuals are at higher risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe outcomes, but the underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood.

Second, we caution against positioning the city-region solely at the receiving end of devolutionary austerity.

In the study, Bid genes from grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus) and rare minnow (Gobiocypris rarus), named CiBid and GrBid, were cloned and analyzed. Bid was constitutively expressed in all examined tissues of grass carp, but the expression level varied in different tissues. Following grass carp reovirus (GCRV) stimulation in vivo, Bid and apoptosis related genes Caspase-9 and Caspase-3 was up-regulated significantly at the late stage of infection. Moreover, we generated a Bid-deficient rare minnow (Bid -/-) to investigate the possible role of Bid in GCRV-triggered apoptosis. We found that the survival time of Bid -/rare minnow after GCRV infection was extended when compared with wildtype fish, the relative copy number of GCRV in Bid -/rare minnow was lower than that in wild-type fish, and the expression level of Caspase-9 and Caspase-3 in Bid -/rare minnow were significantly lower than that in the wild-type fish.

Consequently, here we evaluated the status of air quality 34 during the 8 th phase of unlocking of COVID-19 lockdown (January 2021) at three locations 35 of North India. The first site (S1) was located at Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana-36 PPCB; the second site (S2) at Yamunapuram, Bulandshahr-UPPCB; and the third site (S3) at 37 Okhla Phase-2, Delhi-DPCC. The levels of PM2.5 showed a significant increase of 525.2%, 38 281.2%, and 185.0% at sites S1, S2 and S3, respectively in the unlock 8 (January 2021), in 39 comparison to its concentration in the lockdown phase. Coherently, the levels of PM10 also 40 showed a prominent increase of 284.5%, 189.1%, and 103.9% at sites S3, S1, and S2, 41 respectively during the unlock 8 as compared to its concentration in the lockdown phase. This 42 rise in the concentration of PM2.5 and PM10 could be primarily attributed to the use of 43 biomass fuel, industrial and vehicular emissions, stubble burning considering the agricultural 44 activities at sites S1 and S2. Site S3 is a major industrial hub and has the highest population 45 density among all three sites.

Consequently, here we evaluated the status of air quality 34 during the 8 th phase of unlocking of COVID-19 lockdown (January 2021) at three locations 35 of North India. The first site (S1) was located at Punjab Agricultural University, Ludhiana-36 PPCB; the second site (S2) at Yamunapuram, Bulandshahr-UPPCB; and the third site (S3) at 37 Okhla Phase-2, Delhi-DPCC. The levels of PM2.5 showed a significant increase of 525.2%, 38 281.2%, and 185.0% at sites S1, S2 and S3, respectively in the unlock 8 (January 2021), in 39 comparison to its concentration in the lockdown phase. Coherently, the levels of PM10 also 40 showed a prominent increase of 284.5%, 189.1%, and 103.9% at sites S3, S1, and S2, 41 respectively during the unlock 8 as compared to its concentration in the lockdown phase. This 42 rise in the concentration of PM2.5 and PM10 could be primarily attributed to the use of 43 biomass fuel, industrial and vehicular emissions, stubble burning considering the agricultural 44 activities at sites S1 and S2. Site S3 is a major industrial hub and has the highest population 45 density among all three sites. Consequently, the maximum increase (295.7%) in the NO2 46 levels during the unlock 8 was witnessed at site S3.

Exposure to PM 2.5 is related to activation of the NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, but the mechanism of PM 2.5 affecting the NLRP3 inflammasome is still unclear. Previous studies have shown that PM 2.5 can cause alterations in adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and an increase in extracellular ATP and a decrease in intracellular ATP can trigger the activation process of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Therefore, we emphasize that ATP changes may be the central link and key mechanism of PM 2.5 exposure that activates the NLRP3 inflammasome. This review briefly elucidates and summarizes how PM 2.5 acts on ATP and subsequently further impacts the NLRP3 inflammasome. Investigation of ATP changes due to exposure to PM 2.5 may be essential to regulate NLRP3 inflammasome activation and treat inflammation-related diseases such as coronavirus disease 2019 . \",\n\"PM 2.5 exposure inducing ATP alteration links with NLRP3 inflammasome activation[SEP]Fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) has been the primary air pollutant and the fourth leading risk factor for disease and death in the world.

If consumers remain loyal to a brand, it is because they understand, sympathize with, and value the brand's concept. However, few studies have focused on brand concept as a factor of loyalty. Therefore, this study verified the influence of the brand concept on repurchase intention. Through multiple regression analysis of Apple MacBook Pro, Dyson Big Ball, Nintendo Switch, Facebook, Starbucks, and Tokyo Disney Resort users in Japan, the first hypothesis-consumers who recall a brand concept are more likely to have repurchase intention than those who recall specific features when asked about brand attractiveness-was supported. Furthermore, Fisher's exact test supported a second hypothesis-consumers with high loyalty maintain high-level construal, even if they use a brand frequently and recall the concept as the brand's attractiveness, contrary to construal level theory. By introducing the viewpoint of brand loyalty, the conditions under which construal level theory does not conform were shown. The present study encourages reaffirmation of the importance of brand concept and suggests the concept recall index to effectively use management resources. \",\n\"Brand loyalty explained by concept recall: recognizing the significance of the brand concept compared to features[SEP]Consumers may be attracted to superficial functionality and design, but they may easily switch brands when another company's product/service with higher functionality and a more fashionable design appears.

Methods Using an online research platform, we conducted a survey and consensus-building process involving clinicians and patients with COPD. Results Fifty-five clinicians and 19 patients responded. The majority of clinicians felt able to assess symptom severity (n=52, 95%), reinforce smoking cessation (n=46, 84%) and signpost to other healthcare resources (n=44, 80%). Patients reported that assessing COPD severity and starting new medications were being addressed through remote care. Forty-three and 31 respondents participated in the first and second consensus-building rounds, respectively. When asked to rate the appropriateness of using remote delivery for specific care activities, respondents reached consensus on 5 of 14 items: collecting information about COPD and overall health status (77%), providing COPD education and developing a self-management plan (74%), reinforcing smoking cessation (81%), deciding whether patients should seek inperson care (72%) and initiating a rescue pack (76%).

We present a deep learning-based approach \\u2020 to predict lung infiltrate progression from serial chest radiographs (CXRs) of COVID-19 patients. Our method first utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for feature extraction from patches within the concerned lung zone, and also from neighboring and remote boundary regions. The framework further incorporates a multi-scale Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) with a correlation module for effective predictions. The GRU accepts CNN feature vectors from three different areas as input and generates a fused representation. The correlation module attempts to minimize the correlation loss between hidden representations of concerned and neighboring area feature vectors, while maximizing the loss between the same from concerned and remote regions. Further, we employ an attention module over the output hidden states of each encoder timepoint to generate a context vector. This vector is used as an input to a decoder module to predict patch severity grades at a future timepoint. Finally, we ensemble the patch classification scores to calculate patient-wise grades. Specifically, our framework predicts zone-wise disease severity for a patient on a given day by learning representations from the previous temporal CXRs. Our novel multi-institutional dataset comprises sequential CXR scans from N=93 patients.

Herein, we model protein corona formation on PEG-ylated DLin-MC3-DMA LNPs and identify time-dependent maturation steps that critically unlock their cellular uptake and mRNA delivery. Uptake requires active serum proteins and precedes after a significant (~2 hours) lag-time, which we show can be eliminated by pre-incubating LNPs for 3-4 hours in serum-containing media. This indicates an important role of protein corona maturation for the pharmacokinetic effects of these LNPs. We show, using single-nanoparticle imaging, NMR diffusometry, SANS, and proteomics, that the LNPs, upon serum exposure, undergo rapid PEG-shedding (~30 minutes), followed by a slower rearrangement of the adsorbed protein layer. The PEG-shedding coincides in time with high surface abundance of Apolipoprotein A-II, whereas the LNPs preferentially bind Apolipoprotein E when their maximum uptake-competent state is reached. Finally, we show that pre-incubation of the LNPs enables rapid uptake and allows pulse-chase video-microscopy colocalization experiments with sufficiently short pulse durations to gain improved mechanistic understanding of how intracellular trafficking events determine delivery efficacy, emphasizing early endosomes as important delivery-mediating compartments. \",\n\"Time evolution of PEG-shedding and serum protein coronation determines the cell uptake kinetics and delivery of lipid nanoparticle formulated mRNA[SEP]broad clinical translation of RNA therapeutics.

Methods: This was a cross-sectional analysis of participants with diabetes and poor glycemic control in an ongoing trial (n = 353). We compared the prevalence of unmet needs, self-care behaviors, and diabetes outcomes in successive cohorts of enrollees surveyed pre-pandemic (prior to March 11, 2020, n = 182), in the early stages of the pandemic (May-September, 2020, n = 75), and later (September 2020-January 2021, n = 96) stratified by income and gender. Adjusted multivariable regression models were used to examine trends. Results: More participants with low income reported food insecurity (70% vs. 83%, p < 0.05) and needs related to access to blood glucose supplies (19% vs. 67%, p < 0.05) during the pandemic compared to pre-pandemic levels. In adjusted models among people with low incomes, the odds of housing insecurity increased among participants during the early pandemic months compared with participants pre-pandemic (OR 20.2 [95% CI 2.8-145.2], p < 0.01).

We also examined the indirect impact of NWG on PA through ED controlled by emotional intelligence (EI). A three-wave time-lagged study (paper-pencil based) was performed with 277 employees from various private organisations in Islamabad, Pakistan. The current data were gathered in three phases to reduce common method bias. Study results indicate that NWG positively affects employees' PA. The authors also found ED as a potential mediator in the association between NWG and PA. In addition, the results also indicate the indirect effect of NWG on targets' PA via ED is reduced by targets' EI, with the result that this connection is weak when targets' EI is high. Because this research is limited to a single region of Pakistan, particularly Islamabad, its findings cannot be comprehensive. Future studies should use a larger sample size to accomplish the same study. Future studies may include more organisations (that is, Public) to conduct a comparative analysis of the public and private sectors. This article, based on the affective events theory (AET), argues that EI should be utilised to mitigate the effects of NWG.

The lower limit of detection (LLOD) was determined using a dilution panel of the HDV WHO standard (n = 21/ dilution). Linearity and inclusivity were tested by preparing 10-fold dilution series of cell culture-derived virus (genotype [GT] 1-8; n = 5/dilution). Patient samples containing a variety of bloodborne viral pathogens were tested to confirm exclusivity (n = 60). Results: The LLOD of the HDV utility-channel (HDV_UTC) assay was determined as 3.86 IU/ml (95% CI 2.95-5.05 IU/ml) with a linear range from 10-10 \\u02c7 8 IU/ml (GT1). Linear relationships were observed for all HDV GTs with slopes ranging from -3.481 to -4.134 cycles/log and R 2 from 0.918 to 0.994. Inter-run and intra-run variability were 0.3 and 0.6 Ct (3xLLOD), respectively. No false-positive results were observed. To evaluate clinical performance, 110 serum samples of anti-HDV-Ab+ patients were analyzed using the HDV_UTC and CE-IVD RoboGene assays. 58/110 and 49/110 samples were concordant positive or negative, respectively (overall agreement 97.3%). Quantitative comparison demonstrated a strong correlation (R 2 0.8733; 95% CI 0.8914-0.9609; p value <0.0001). Conclusion: The use of highly automated, sample-to-result solutions for molecular diagnostics holds many inherent benefits over manual workflows, including improved reliability, reproducibility and dynamic scaling of testing capacity. The assay we established showed excellent analytical and clinical performance, with inclusivity for all HDV GTs and a limit of quantification of 10 IU/ml, making it a sensitive new tool for HDV screening and viral load monitoring. Lay summary: The hepatitis delta virus (HDV) causes a severe form of inflammation in the liver. We developed a tool for molecular diagnostics, a polymerase chain reaction HDV assay that showed great performance. It can be used to improve diagnosis of HDV, as well as for monitoring treatment responses. The assay allows for quantification of the virus in the tested samples and is performed on a fully automated platform (cobas6800), which provides various benefits including less handson time and excellent comparability of test results. \",\n\"Clinical establishment of a laboratory developed quantitative HDV PCR assay on the cobas6800 high- throughput system[SEP]Background & Aims: Currently available HDV PCR assays are characterized by considerable run-to-run and inter-laboratory variability.

Cartilage differentiation and chondrocyte maturation are required for normal skeletal development, but the intracellular pathways regulating this process remain largely unclear. This study was designed to identify novel genes that might help clarify the molecular mechanisms of chondrogenesis. Chondrogenesis was induced by culturing human bone marrow (BM) derived MSCs in micromass pellets in the presence of defined medium for 3, 7, 14 or 21 days. Several genes regulated during chondrogenesis were then identified by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Using an ABI microarray system, we determined the differential gene expression profiles of differentiated chondrocytes and BM-MSCs. Normalization of this data resulted in the identification of 1,486 differentially expressed genes. To verify gene expression profiles determined by microarray analysis, the expression levels of 10 genes with high fold changes were confirmed by RT-PCR. Gene expression patterns of 9 genes (Hrad6B, annexinA2, BMP-7, contactin-1, peroxiredoxin-1, heat shock transcription factor-2, synaptotagmin IV, serotonin receptor-7, Axl) in RT-PCR were similar to the microarray gene expression patterns.

Methods: Patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) underwent standard neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy with 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions. T2-weighted MRI prior and after the treatment session were acquired to contour gross tumor volumes (GTVs) and organs at risk (OARs). The datasets were used to simulate four different boost strategies (all with 15 Gy/5 fractions in addition to 50.4 Gy): up-front boost (5 daily fractions in the first week of treatment) and an adaptive boost (one boost fraction per week). Both strategies were planned using standard and reduced PTV margins. Intra-fraction motion was assessed by pre-and post-treatment MRI-based contours. Results: Five patients were included and a total of 44 MRI sets were evaluated. The median PTV volumes of the adaptive boost were significantly smaller than for the up-front boost (81.4 cm 3 vs 44.4 cm 3 for PTV with standard margins; 31.2 cm 3 vs 15 cm 3 for PTV with reduced margins; p = 0.031). With reduced margins the rectum was significantly better spared with an adaptive boost rather than with an up-front boost: V60Gy and V65Gy were 41.2% and 24.8% compared with 59% and 29.9%, respectively (p = 0.031). Median GTV intra-fractional motion was 2 mm (range 0-8 mm). Conclusions: The data suggest that the adaptive boost strategy exploiting tumor-shrinkage and reduced margin might result in better sparing of rectum and anal canal. Individual margin assessment, motion management and real-time adaptive radiotherapy appear attractive applications of the 1.5 T MR-Linac for further testing of individualized and safe dose escalation in patients with rectal cancer. \",\n\"-NC-ND license (http://creativecommons.org/ licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/)[SEP]Purpose: To compare treatment plans of two different rectal boost strategies: up-front versus adaptive boost at the 1.5 T MR-Linac.

Having performed a kinase inhibitor library screening in macrophages, here we identify protein-tyrosine kinase 2-beta (PTK2B/PYK2) as a putative IRF5 kinase. PYK2-deficient macrophages display impaired endogenous IRF5 activation, leading to reduction of inflammatory gene expression. Meanwhile, a PYK2 inhibitor, defactinib, has a similar effect on IRF5 activation in vitro, and induces a transcriptomic signature in macrophages similar to that caused by IRF5 deficiency. Finally, defactinib reduces pro-inflammatory cytokines in human colon biopsies from patients with ulcerative colitis, as well as in a mouse colitis model. Our results thus implicate a function of PYK2 in regulating the inflammatory response in the gut via the IRF5 innate sensing pathway, thereby opening opportunities for related therapeutic interventions for inflammatory bowel diseases and other inflammatory conditions. \",\n\"Defactinib inhibits PYK2 phosphorylation of IRF5 and reduces intestinal inflammation[SEP]Interferon regulating factor 5 (IRF5) is a multifunctional regulator of immune responses, and has a key pathogenic function in gut inflammation, but how IRF5 is modulated is still unclear.

Some antihypertensive drugs affect ACE2 expression or activity (ACE inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers [ARBs]), suggesting use of other hypertensives might be preferable, such as calcium channel blockers (CCBs). Given the limited evidence, the International Society of Hypertension does not support such a policy. Methods: We used a Mendelian randomization study to obtain unconfounded associations of antihypertensives, instrumented by published genetic variants in genes regulating target proteins of these drugs, with immune (lymphocyte and neutrophil percentage) and inflammatory (tumour necrosis factor alpha [TNF-\\u03b1]) markers in the largest available genome-wide association studies. Results: Genetically predicted effects of ACE inhibitors increased lymphocyte percentage (0.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.35, 1.22), decreased neutrophil percentage (\\u22120.64, 95% CI \\u22121.09, \\u22120.20) and possibly lowered TNF-\\u03b1 (\\u22124.92, 95% CI \\u22128.50, \\u22121.33).

Full-length y cDNA clones were obtained when oligonucleotides specific for the 5'4erminal sequence of RNA (Y were used in the cloning procedure, but not when RNA r-specific oligonucleotides were used. Sequence analysis of six putative y cDNA clones revealed that nucleotides l-70 possess 89% homology with the first 70 nucleotides of RNA (Y. This leader region is separated from the -r-specific coding region by an eight-base intervening sequence common to both CV17 RNAs (Y and y. Northern and Southern hybridization with oligonucleotide probes specific for either 01 or y leader sequences indicated that CV17 y cDNA clones are representative of native CV17 y RNAs. Furthermore, bioassays indicated that in vitro transcripts derived from these y cDNA clones were infectious when coinoculated with in vitro transcripts of full-length (Y and /3 cDNA clones. Thus, the evidence suggests that RNA y of BSMV strain CV17 is a recombinant molecule which may have arisen as a result of natural recombination between RNAs (Y and y. \"],\n [\"Article Neuron Signal Propagation Analysis of Cytokine-Storm induced Demyelination\",\n\"The COVID-19 pandemic has shaken the world unprecedentedly, where it has affected the vast global population both socially and economically. The pandemic has also opened our eyes to the many threats that novel virus infections can pose for humanity. While numerous unknowns are being investigated in terms of the distributed damage that the virus can do to the human body, recent studies have also shown that the infection can lead to lifelong sequelae that could affect other parts of the body, and one example is the brain. As part of this work, we investigate how viral infection can affect the brain by modelling and simulating a neuron's behaviour under demyelination that is affected by the cytokine storm. We quantify the effects of cytokine-induced demyelination on the propagation of action potential signals within a neuron. We used information and communication theory analysis on the signal propagated through the axonal pathway under different intensity levels of demyelination to analyse these effects. Our simulations demonstrate that virus-induced degeneration can play a role in the signal power and spiking rate and the probability of releasing neurotransmitters and compromising the propagation and processing of information between the neurons. We also propose a transfer function that models these attenuation effects that degenerates the action potential, where this model has the potential to be used as a framework for the analysis of virus-induced neurodegeneration that can pave the way to improved understanding of virus-induced demyelination. SIGNIFICANCE Virus infections are increasingly linked to neurological pathologies as these viral agents also show neurotropic properties. Despite their success in invading the brain, neurotropic viruses can cause pro-inflammatory immune responses that can last for months after the virus is cleared from the nervous system. Several studies have shown that this neuroinflammation can lead to neurodegeneration. Unfortunately, a neuron that has undergone a demyelinating degeneration never comes back to its healthy state. The present study provided a quantitative analysis concerning cytokineinduced demyelination triggered by a viral infection. As such, it provides a model that describes how signal propagation and neuronal communication is compromised. It also offers a framework for the study of demyelination as an attenuating factor. \",\n\"Article Neuron Signal Propagation Analysis of Cytokine-Storm induced Demyelination[SEP]The COVID-19 pandemic has shaken the world unprecedentedly, where it has affected the vast global population both socially and economically.

These pathways dampen the immune response by providing brakes on activated T cells, thereby ensuring more uniform and controlled immune reactions and avoiding immune hyper-responsiveness and autoimmunity. Cancer cells often exploit these regulatory controls through a variety of immune subversion mechanisms, which facilitate immune escape and tumor survival. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) effectively block negative regulatory signals, thereby augmenting immune attack and tumor killing. This process is a double-edged sword in which release of regulatory controls is felt to be responsible for both the therapeutic efficacy of ICI therapy and the driver of immune-related adverse events (IrAEs). These adverse immune reactions are common, typically low-grade and may affect virtually every organ system. In the early clinical trials, lung IrAEs were rarely described. However, with ever-expanding clinical applications and more complex ICI-containing regimens, lung events, in particular, pneumonitis, have become increasingly recognized. ICI-related lung injury is clinically distinct from other types of lung toxicity and may lead to death in advanced stage disease. Thus, knowledge regarding the key characteristics and optimal treatment of lung-IrAEs is critical to good outcomes. This review provides an overview of lung-IrAEs, including risk factors and epidemiology, as well as clinical, radiologic, and histopathologic features of ICI-related lung injury.

To enhance immunogenicity and mitigate the potential vaccine-induced immunopathology, CpG 1018, a Th1biasing synthetic toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) agonist was selected as an adjuvant candidate. S-2P in combination with CpG 1018 and aluminum hydroxide (alum) was found to be the most potent immunogen and induced high titer of neutralizing antibodies in sera of immunized mice against pseudotyped lentivirus reporter or live wild-type SARS-CoV-2. In addition, the antibodies elicited were able to cross-neutralize pseudovirus containing the spike protein of the D614G variant, indicating the potential for broad spectrum protection. A marked Th1 dominant response was noted from cytokines secreted by splenocytes of mice immunized with CpG 1018 and alum.

We included patients (n = 39,460) aged 18 years or older with one or more apical-4-chamber echocardiogram videos (n = 70,066) from Stanford Healthcare for training and internal testing of EchoNet-Lab's performance in estimating the most proximal biomarker result.

We model how screening for olfactory dysfunction, with reflexive molecular tests, could be beneficial in reducing community spread of SARS-CoV-2 by varying testing frequency and the prevalence, duration, and onset time of olfactory dysfunction. We find that monitoring olfactory dysfunction could reduce spread via regular screening, and could reduce risk when used at point-of-entry for single-day events. In light of these estimated impacts, and because olfactory tests can be mass produced at low cost and self-administered, we suggest that screening for olfactory dysfunction could be a high impact and cost-effective method for broad COVID-19 screening and surveillance. \",\n\"Modeling the effectiveness of olfactory testing to limit SARS-CoV-2 transmission[SEP]A central problem in the COVID-19 pandemic is that there is not enough testing to prevent infectious spread of SARS-CoV-2, causing surges and lockdowns with human and economic toll.

Introduction Although often used in medicine, video consultations are less commonly used in dentistry. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the orthodontic team at Croydon University Hospital introduced the use of video consultations to provide continued patient care at a time when face-to-face appointments were not possible. Aim To assess patient and clinician satisfaction with the Attend Anywhere video consultations used by the orthodontic team at Croydon University Hospital. Method Two separate satisfaction questionnaires were piloted and developed: one for patients and one for clinicians. All patients scheduled for a video consultation between 15 May 2020 and 15 June 2020 were invited to complete a patient satisfaction questionnaire at the end of their consultation. In total, 114 patients attended video consultations in the time period assessed, of which 111 completed a satisfaction questionnaire (97.4% response rate). Fifty-six percent of patients were female with an average age of 16.5 years. Patient satisfaction was highest for the video consultations being easy to use and convenient. Over 90% of patients strongly agreed or agreed with all of the satisfaction statements and in terms of whether they would recommend using video consultations. Approximately one-third of patients preferred the video consultation to a faceto-face appointment and one-third of patients were neutral. This study found high levels of patient satisfaction with video consultations in orthodontics. Thoughtful consideration needs to be given to the application of video clinics, going forwards, to ensure that high standards of patient care are maintained. \",\n\"Patient and clinician satisfaction with video consultations in dentistry -part one: patient satisfaction[SEP]Highlights the potential for this new and evolving area in dentistry. Introduction Although often used in medicine, video consultations are less commonly used in dentistry. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the orthodontic team at Croydon University Hospital introduced the use of video consultations to provide continued patient care at a time when face-to-face appointments were not possible. Aim To assess patient and clinician satisfaction with the Attend Anywhere video consultations used by the orthodontic team at Croydon University Hospital. Method Two separate satisfaction questionnaires were piloted and developed: one for patients and one for clinicians. All patients scheduled for a video consultation between 15 May 2020 and 15 June 2020 were invited to complete a patient satisfaction questionnaire at the end of their consultation. In total, 114 patients attended video consultations in the time period assessed, of which 111 completed a satisfaction questionnaire (97.4% response rate).

We describe how a large academic radiology department achieved socially distant 'remote readouts', provide trainee and attending perspectives on this early experience, and propose ways by which 'remote readouts' can be used effectively by training programs beyond COVID-19. Beginning March 2020, radiologists were relocated to workspaces outside of conventional reading rooms. Information technologies were employed to allow for 'remote readouts' between trainees and attendings. An optional anonymous open-ended survey regarding remote readouts was administered to radiology trainees and attendings as a quality improvement initiative. From the responses, response themes were abstracted using thematic analysis. Descriptive statistics of the qualitative data were calculated. Radiologist workstations from 14 traditional reading rooms were relocated to 36 workspaces across the hospital system. Two models of remote readouts, synchronous and asynchronous, were developed, facilitated by commercially-available information technologies. 39/105 (37%) trainees and 42/90 (47%) attendings responded to the survey. Main response themes included: social distancing, technology, autonomy/competency, efficiency, education/feedback and atmosphere/professional relationship. 148 positive versus 97 negative comments were reported. Social distancing, technology and autonomy/competency were most positively rated. Trainees and attending perspectives differed regarding the efficiency of remote readouts. 'Remote readouts', compliant with social distancing measures, are feasible in academic radiology practice settings. Perspectives from our initial experience provide insight into how this can be accomplished, opportunities for improvement and future application, beyond the COVID-19 pandemic. \",\n\"Trainee and attending perspectives on remote radiology readouts in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic[SEP]Social distancing mandates due to COVID-19 have necessitated adaptations to radiology trainee workflow and educational practices, including the radiology 'readout'.

The post-exposure antibody therapies to prevent EBOV infection are considered effective as of yet. However, owing to the poor thermal stability of mammalian antibodies, their application in the tropics has remained limited. Therefore, a thermostable therapeutic antibody against EBOV was developed modelled on the poultry(chicken) immunoglobulin Y (IgY). The IgY antibodies retaining their neutralising activity at 25\\u02daC for one year, displayed excellent thermal stability, opposed to conventional polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) or monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Laying hens were immunised with a variety of EBOV vaccine candidates and it was confirmed that VSV\\u0394G/EBOVGP encoding the EBOV glycoprotein could induce high titer neutralising antibodies against EBOV. The therapeutic efficacy of immune IgY antibodies in vivo was evaluated in the newborn Balb/c mice who have been challenged with the VSV\\u0394G/EBOVGP model. Mice that have been challenged with a lethal dose of the pseudovirus were treated 2 or 24 h post-infection with different doses of anti-EBOV IgY. The group receiving a high dose of 10 6 NAU/kg (neutralising antibody units/kilogram) showed complete protection with no symptoms of a disease, while the low-dose group was only partially protected. Conversely, all mice receiving naive IgY died within 10 days. In conclusion, the anti-EBOV IgY exhibits excellent thermostability and protective efficacy.

Here, we investigate 17 published experimental and clinical datasets related to SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as datasets from the betacoronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS as well as Streptococcus pneumonia, HCV, Zika virus, Dengue virus, influenza H3N2, and RSV.

In total, we identified 3-8 epitopes for each of the six most prevalent human leukocyte antigen (HLA) types.

Limited information on the molecular mechanism of SFTSV infection and pathogenesis impedes the development of effective vaccines and drugs for SFTS prevention and treatment. In this study, an isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ)-based quantitative proteomic analysis of SFTSV-infected HEK 293 cells was performed to explore dynamic host cellular protein responses toward SFTSV infection. A total of 433 of 5,606 host proteins involved in different biological processes were differentially regulated by SFTSV infection. The proteomic results highlighted a potential role of endoplasmic reticular stress-triggered unfolded-protein response (UPR) in SFTSV infection. Further functional studies confirmed that all three major branches of the UPR, including the PKRlike endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), the activating transcription factor-6 (ATF6), and the inositol-requiring protein-1 (IRE1)/X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1) pathways, were activated by SFTSV. However, only the former two pathways play a crucial role in SFTSV infection. Furthermore, expression of SFTSV glycoprotein (GP) alone was sufficient to stimulate the UPR, whereas suppression of PERK and ATF6 notably decreased GP expression. Interestingly, two other newly discovered phleboviruses, Heartland virus and Guertu virus, also stimulated the UPR, suggesting a common mechanism shared by these genetically related phleboviruses. This study provides a global view to our knowledge on how host cells respond to SFTSV infection and highlights that host cell UPR plays an important role in phlebovirus infection. IMPORTANCE Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) is an emerging tick-borne bunyavirus that causes severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome in humans, with a mortality rate reaching up to 30% in some outbreaks. There are currently no U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved vaccines or specific antivirals available against SFTSV. To comprehensively understand the molecular interactions occurring between SFTSV and the host cell, we exploit quantitative proteomic approach to investigate the dynamic host cellular responses to SFTSV infection. The results highlight multiple biological processes being regulated by SFTSV infection. Among these, we focused on exploration of the mechanism of how SFTSV infection stimulates the host cell's unfolded-protein response (UPR) and identified the UPR as a common feature shared by SFTSV-related new emerging phleboviruses. This study, for the first time to our knowledge, provides a global map for host cellular responses to SFTSV infection and highlighted potential host targets for further research. \",\n\"Quantitative Proteomic Analysis Reveals Unfolded-Protein Response Involved in Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome Virus Infection CELLULAR RESPONSE TO INFECTION crossm[SEP]Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging, highly pathogenic, infectious disease caused by infection with a newly discovered tick-borne phlebovirus, SFTS virus (SFTSV). Limited information on the molecular mechanism of SFTSV infection and pathogenesis impedes the development of effective vaccines and drugs for SFTS prevention and treatment. In this study, an isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ)-based quantitative proteomic analysis of SFTSV-infected HEK 293 cells was performed to explore dynamic host cellular protein responses toward SFTSV infection. A total of 433 of 5,606 host proteins involved in different biological processes were differentially regulated by SFTSV infection. The proteomic results highlighted a potential role of endoplasmic reticular stress-triggered unfolded-protein response (UPR) in SFTSV infection. Further functional studies confirmed that all three major branches of the UPR, including the PKRlike endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), the activating transcription factor-6 (ATF6), and the inositol-requiring protein-1 (IRE1)/X-box-binding protein 1 (XBP1) pathways, were activated by SFTSV. However, only the former two pathways play a crucial role in SFTSV infection. Furthermore, expression of SFTSV glycoprotein (GP) alone was sufficient to stimulate the UPR, whereas suppression of PERK and ATF6 notably decreased GP expression. Interestingly, two other newly discovered phleboviruses, Heartland virus and Guertu virus, also stimulated the UPR, suggesting a common mechanism shared by these genetically related phleboviruses. This study provides a global view to our knowledge on how host cells respond to SFTSV infection and highlights that host cell UPR plays an important role in phlebovirus infection.

Here, we expressed the HPV16 E6 antigen on Lactobacillus casei (L. casei) and investigated E6-specific CMI following oral administration of the L. casei-PgsA-E6 to mice. Surface expression of HPV16 E6 antigens was confirmed and mice were orally inoculated with the L. casei-PgsA or the L. casei-PgsA-E6. Compared to the L. casei-PgsA-treated mice, significantly higher levels of serum IgG and mucosal IgA were observed in L. casei-PgsA-E6-immunized mice; these differences were significantly enhanced after boost. Consistent with this, systemic and local CMI were significantly increased after the boost, as shown by increased counts of IFN-c-secreting cells in splenocytes, mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN), and vaginal samples. Furthermore, in the TC-1 tumor model, animals receiving the orally administered L. casei-PgsA-E6 showed reduced tumor size and increased survival rate versus mice receiving control (L. casei-PgsA) immunization. We also found that L. casei-PgsA-E6-induced antitumor effect was decreased by in vivo depletion of CD4 ? or CD8 ? T cells. Collectively, these results indicate that the oral administration of lactobacilli bearing the surface-displayed E6 protein induces T cell-mediated cellular immunity and antitumor effects in mice.

The hostepathogen relationship in COPD is a complex, dynamic process characterised by frequent changes in pathogens, their strains and loads, and subsequent host immune responses. Exacerbations are detrimental events in the course of COPD and evidence suggests that 70% may be caused by microorganisms. When considering bacterial exacerbations, recent findings based on molecular typing have demonstrated that the acquisition of new strains of bacteria or antigenic changes in pre-existing strains are the most important triggers for exacerbation onset. Even in clinically stable COPD patients the presence of microorganisms in their lower airways may cause harmful effects and induce chronic low-grade airway inflammation leading to increased exacerbation frequency, an accelerated decline in lung function and impaired health-related quality of life. Besides intraluminal localisation in the distal airways, bacteria can be found in the bronchial walls and parenchymal lung tissue of COPD patients. Therefore, the isolation of pathogenic bacteria in stable COPD should be considered as a form of chronic infection rather than colonisation. This new approach may have important implications for the management of patients with COPD. \\u00aa \",\n\"Chronic bronchial infection in COPD.

RHD, characterized by hemorrhaging, liver necrosis, and high morbidity and mortality in rabbits and hares, causes severe economic losses in the rabbit industry worldwide. Due to the lack of an efficient in-vitro propagation system for RHDV, the current vaccine is produced via chemical inactivation of crude RHDV preparation derived from the livers of infected rabbits. Inactivated vaccines are effective for controlling RHD, but the potential problems of biosafety and animal welfare have negative effects on the application of inactivated vaccines. In this study, an oral Lactobacillus casei (L. casei) vaccine was used as an antigen delivery system to express RHDV capsid protein VP60(VP1)-eGFP fusion protein. The expression of the recombinant protein was confirmed via western blotting and immunofluorescence (IFA).

RHD, characterized by hemorrhaging, liver necrosis, and high morbidity and mortality in rabbits and hares, causes severe economic losses in the rabbit industry worldwide. Due to the lack of an efficient in-vitro propagation system for RHDV, the current vaccine is produced via chemical inactivation of crude RHDV preparation derived from the livers of infected rabbits. Inactivated vaccines are effective for controlling RHD, but the potential problems of biosafety and animal welfare have negative effects on the application of inactivated vaccines. In this study, an oral Lactobacillus casei (L. casei) vaccine was used as an antigen delivery system to express RHDV capsid protein VP60(VP1)-eGFP fusion protein. The expression of the recombinant protein was confirmed via western blotting and immunofluorescence (IFA). Our results indicate that oral administration of this probiotic vaccine can stimulate secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA)-based mucosal and IgG-based humoral immune responses in rabbits. The immunized rabbits were completely protected against challenge with RHDV. Our findings indicate that the L. casei expression system is a new strategy for the development of a safe and efficient vaccine against RHDV. \"],\n [\"Identification of the source events for aerosol generation during oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy\",\n\"Objective To determine if oesophago-gastroduodenoscopy (OGD) generates increased levels of aerosol in conscious patients and identify the source events. Design A prospective, environmental aerosol monitoring study, undertaken in an ultraclean environment, on patients undergoing OGD. Sampling was performed 20 cm away from the patient's mouth using an optical particle sizer. Aerosol levels during OGD were compared with tidal breathing and voluntary coughs within subject. Results Patients undergoing bariatric surgical assessment were recruited (mean body mass index 44 and mean age 40 years, n=15). A low background particle concentration in theatres (3 L \\u22121 ) enabled detection of aerosol generation by tidal breathing (mean particle concentration 118 L \\u22121 ). Aerosol recording during OGD showed an average particle number concentration of 595 L \\u22121 with a wide range (3-4320 L \\u22121 ). Bioaerosol-generating events, namely, coughing or burping, were common. Coughing was evoked in 60% of the endoscopies, with a greater peak concentration and a greater total number of sampled particles than the patient's reference voluntary coughs (11 710 vs 2320 L \\u22121 and 780 vs 191 particles, n=9 and p=0.008). Endoscopies with coughs generated a higher level of aerosol than tidal breathing, whereas those without coughs were not different to the background. Burps also generated increased aerosol concentration, similar to those recorded during voluntary coughs. The insertion and removal of the endoscope were not aerosol generating unless a cough was triggered. Conclusion Coughing evoked during OGD is the main source of the increased aerosol levels, and therefore, OGD should be regarded as a procedure with high risk of producing respiratory aerosols. OGD should be conducted with airborne personal protective equipment and appropriate precautions in those patients who are at risk of having COVID-19 or other respiratory pathogens. \",\n\"Identification of the source events for aerosol generation during oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy[SEP]Objective To determine if oesophago-gastroduodenoscopy (OGD) generates increased levels of aerosol in conscious patients and identify the source events.

Here, in an attempt to design an efficient vaccine, a thorough immunoinformatics approach was followed to predict the most suitable viral proteins epitopes for building that vaccine. Methods: The amino acid sequences of four structural proteins (S, M, N, E) along with one potentially antigenic accessory protein (ORF1a) of SARS-CoV-2 were inspected for the most appropriate epitopes to be used for building the vaccine construct. Several immunoinformatics tools were used to assess the antigenicity (VaxiJen server), immunogenicity (IEDB immunogenicity tool), allergenicity (AlgPred), toxigenicity (ToxinPred server), interferongamma inducing capacity (IFNepitope server), and the physicochemical properties of the construct (ProtParam tool). Results: The final candidate vaccine construct consisted of 468 amino acids, encompassing 29 epitopes. The CTL epitopes that passed the antigenicity, allergenicity, toxigenicity and immunogenicity assessment were four epitopes from S protein, one from M protein, two from N protein, 12 from the ORF1a polyprotein and none from E protein. While the HTL epitopes that passed the antigenicity, allergenicity, toxigenicity and INF-\\u03b3 were one from S protein, three from M protein, six from the ORF1a polyprotein and none from N and E proteins. All the vaccine properties and its ability to trigger the humoral and cell-mediated immune response were validated computationally. Molecular modeling, docking to TLR3, simulation, and molecular dynamics were also carried out. Finally, a molecular clone using pET28::mAID expression plasmid vector was prepared.

Active learning for entity resolution aims to learn high-quality matching models while minimizing the human labeling effort by selecting only the most informative record pairs for labeling. Most active learning methods proposed so far, start with an empty set of labeled record pairs and iteratively improve the prediction quality of a classification model by asking for new labels. The absence of adequate labeled data in the early active learning iterations leads to unstable models of low quality which is known as the cold start problem. In our work we solve the cold start problem using an unsupervised matching method to bootstrap active learning. We implement a thresholding heuristic that considers pre-calculated similarity scores and assigns matching labels with some degree of noise at no manual labeling cost. The noisy labels are used for initializing the active learning process and throughout the whole active learning cycle for model learning and query selection. We evaluate our pipeline with six datasets from three different entity resolution settings using active learning with a committee-based query strategy and show it successfully deals with the cold start problem. Comparing our method against two active learning baselines without bootstrapping, we show that it can additionally lead to overall improved learned models in terms of F1 score and stability. \",\n\"Unsupervised Bootstrapping of Active Learning for Entity Resolution[SEP]Entity resolution is one of the central challenges when integrating data from large numbers of data sources.

The possible ideal strategy of testing each patient before each shift with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is not feasible. We aimed to study the effectiveness of fortnightly screening with RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 in curbing transmission. Methods: Between July 1, 2020 and September 30, 2020, all 273 patients receiving hemodialysis were subjected to fortnightly testing for SARS-Cov-2 in the unit to detect asymptomatic patients. The cost and effectiveness of universal testing in preventing transmission were analyzed using susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) modeling assuming R 0 of 2.2. Results: Of 273 MHD patients, 55 (20.1%) found infected with SARS-CoV-2 over 3 months. Six (10.9%) were symptomatic, and 49 (89.1%) asymptomatic at the time of testing. Six (10.9%) asymptomatic patients develop symptoms later, and 43 (78.2%) remained asymptomatic. A total of seven (6.1%) HCWs also tested positive for the virus. Fortnightly universal testing is cost-effective, and SIR modeling proved effective in preventing person-to-person transmission. Conclusions: Repeated universal testing in maintenance hemodialysis patients detected 89% of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 patients over 3 months and appeared to be an effective strategy to prevent person-to-person transmission in the dialysis unit. \",\n\"Aftermath of fortnightly universal testing for severe acute respiratory corona virus-2 infection in maintenance hemodialysis patients[SEP]Introduction: Asymptomatic maintenance hemodialysis patients with acute respiratory corona virus-2 (SARS-COV-2) are missed with pre-dialysis screening without testing.

Methods: Between July 1, 2020 and September 30, 2020, all 273 patients receiving hemodialysis were subjected to fortnightly testing for SARS-Cov-2 in the unit to detect asymptomatic patients. The cost and effectiveness of universal testing in preventing transmission were analyzed using susceptible-infectious-removed (SIR) modeling assuming R 0 of 2.2. Results: Of 273 MHD patients, 55 (20.1%) found infected with SARS-CoV-2 over 3 months. Six (10.9%) were symptomatic, and 49 (89.1%) asymptomatic at the time of testing. Six (10.9%) asymptomatic patients develop symptoms later, and 43 (78.2%) remained asymptomatic. A total of seven (6.1%) HCWs also tested positive for the virus. Fortnightly universal testing is cost-effective, and SIR modeling proved effective in preventing person-to-person transmission. Conclusions: Repeated universal testing in maintenance hemodialysis patients detected 89% of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 patients over 3 months and appeared to be an effective strategy to prevent person-to-person transmission in the dialysis unit. \"],\n [\"ACE2/ACE imbalance and impaired vasoreparative functions of stem/progenitor cells in aging\",\n\"Aging increases risk for ischemic vascular diseases. Bone marrow-derived hematopoietic stem/ progenitor cells (HSPCs) are known to stimulate vascular regeneration. Activation of either the Mas receptor (MasR) by angiotensin-(1-7) (Ang-(1-7)) or angiotensinconverting enzyme-2 (ACE2) stimulates vasoreparative functions in HSPCs. This study tested if aging is associated with decreased ACE2 expression in HSPCs and if Ang-(1-7) restores vasoreparative functions. Flow cytometric enumeration of Lin \\u2212 CD45 low CD34 + cells was carried out in peripheral blood of male or female individuals (22-83 years of age). Activity of ACE2 or the classical angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) was determined in lysates of HSPCs. Lin \\u2212 Sca-1 + cKit + (LSK) cells were isolated from young (3-5 months) or old (20-22 months) mice, and migration and proliferation were evaluated. Old mice were treated with Ang-(1-7), and mobilization of HSPCs was determined following ischemia induced by femoral ligation. A laser Doppler blood flow meter was used to determine blood flow. Aging was associated with decreased number (Spearman r = \\u2212 0.598, P < 0.0001, n = 56), decreased ACE2 (r = \\u2212 0.677, P < 0.0004), and increased ACE activity (r = 0.872, P < 0.0001) (n = 23) in HSPCs. Migration or proliferation of LSK cells in basal or in response to stromal-derived factor-1\\u03b1 in old cells is attenuated compared to young, and these dysfunctions were reversed by Ang-(1-7). Ischemia increased the number of circulating LSK cells in young mice, and blood flow to ischemic areas was recovered. These responses were impaired in old mice but were restored by treatment with Ang- (1-7) . These results suggest that activation of ACE2 or MasR would be a promising approach for enhancing ischemic vascular repair in aging. \",\n\"ACE2/ACE imbalance and impaired vasoreparative functions of stem/progenitor cells in aging[SEP]Aging increases risk for ischemic vascular diseases.

This retrospective study examined the fecal tests records from 1111 dogs and 203 cats with diarrhea submitted to a diagnostic laboratory in the city of Medellin between January and May 2018. The detection of parasites was carried out by direct smears and simple flotation methods. Parasitic organisms were detected in feces from 464 (41.7%) dogs and 96 (47.3%) cats. In order of decreasing prevalence, the parasites detected in dogs were: Giardia intestinalis (13%), ancylostomids (12.6%), Entamoeba spp. (6.1%), coccidian oocysts (5.8%), Toxocara spp. (5.6%) and Dipylidium caninum (1.3%). In cats, the prevalence was: Giardia intestinalis (20%), coccidian oocysts (8.9%), Entamoeba spp. (7.9%), ancylostomids (6.4%), Toxocara spp. (2.5%) and Dipylidium caninum (2%). Age, but not gender, was a predisposing factor, as puppies and kittens had significantly higher infection rates that older age categories. The majority of Giardia intestinalis positive cases occurred in puppies (109/145, 75.2%) and kittens (19/36, 52.8%), making this parasite the most prevalent in amongst animals with diarrhea. Out of 117 positive infections in the adult dog population, ancylostomids accounted for 56 cases (47.9%) and was the most common parasite in this age group. In conclusion, although these results do not imply a cause and effect relationship, they are an estimate of the type of parasites that may be most commonly associated with diarrhea in dogs and cats. The lower diagnostic sensitivity of the traditional methods used here as compared to more contemporary techniques like fecal flotation with centrifugation and PCR, may have underestimated the actual prevalence and diminished the detection of coinfections.

In this context, the population is concerned about the potential health risks associated with the Radio Frequency (RF) emissions from 5G equipment, with several communities actively working toward stopping the 5G deployment. To face these concerns, in this work, we analyze the health risks associated with 5G exposure by adopting a new and comprehensive viewpoint, based on the communications engineering perspective. By exploiting our background, we investigate the alleged health effects of 5G exposure and critically review the latest works that are often referenced to support the health concerns from 5G. We then precisely examine the up-to-date metrics, regulations, and assessment of compliance procedures for 5G exposure, by evaluating the latest guidelines from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP), the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), and the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC), as well as the national regulations in more than 220 countries. We also thoroughly analyze the main health risks that are frequently associated with specific 5G features (e.g., multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), beamforming, cell densification, adoption of millimeter waves, and connection of millions of devices). Finally, we examine the risk mitigation techniques based on communications engineering that can be implemented to reduce the exposure from 5G gNB and UE. Overall, we argue that the widely perceived health risks that are attributed to 5G are not supported by scientific evidence from communications engineering. In addition, we explain how the solutions to minimize the health risks from 5G (including currently unknown effects) are already mature and ready to be implemented. Finally, future works, e.g., aimed at evaluating long-term impacts of 5G exposure, as well as innovative solutions to further reduce the RF emissions, are suggested. \",\n\"Health Risks Associated with 5G Exposure: A View from the Communications Engineering Perspective[SEP]The deployment of the fifth-generation (5G) wireless communication services requires the installation of 5G next-generation Node-B Base Stations (gNBs) over the territory and the wide adoption of 5G User Equipment (UE).

Five RT-PCR-positive cases underwent in situ hybridisation (ISH) for SARS-CoV-2. Patients with lethal COVID-19 infection were mostly male (78%) and had a high incidence of hypertension (91%), coronary artery disease (61%), and diabetes mellitus (48%). Patients with positive myocardial RT-PCR died earlier after hospital admission (5 versus 12 days, p < 0.001) than patients with negative RT-PCR.

Nevertheless, presleep arousal during the pandemic has been substantially overlooked. Since hyperarousal represents one of the main factors for the development and the perpetuation of chronic insomnia disorder, the assessment of variables associated with high levels of pre-sleep arousal during the pandemic is clinically relevant. The study aimed to assess the prevalence and predictors of perceived sleep quality and presleep arousal in an Italian sample during the COVID-19 lockdown. Methods: We used an online survey to collect self-reported sociodemographic, environmental, clinical, sleep, and sleep-related data. Our final sample included 761 participants. Results: Beyond a high frequency of poor sleep quality, depressive and stress symptoms, our results show that almost half of the sample suffered from clinically relevant levels of at least one component (ie, cognitive, somatic) of pre-sleep arousal. Subjects with greater pre-sleep arousal exhibited poorer sleep quality. Also, sleep quality was strongly associated with somatic and cognitive pre-sleep arousal. Regarding the predictors of sleep and sleep-related measures, depressive and event-related stress symptoms were the main factors associated with both poor sleep quality and pre-sleep arousal components. Moreover, specific sociodemographic and environmental variables were uniquely related to sleep quality, cognitive or somatic pre-sleep arousal. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the assessment of specific sleep-related factors (ie, pre-sleep arousal), together with more global measures of sleep quality, may be crucial to depict the complex impact of the pandemic on sleep, and to help prevent and counteract the spread of insomnia symptoms. \",\n\"Pre-sleep arousal and sleep quality during the COVID-19 lockdown in Italy[SEP]Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic has strongly affected daily habits and psychological wellbeing, and many studies point to large modifications in several sleep and sleep-related domains.

We reported a uremic patient with vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (VRE-fm) pneumonia, possibly related to epileptic seizures. Case presentation: A 57-year old man with uremia on hemodialysis was admitted to the hospital with complaint of recurrent epileptic seizures, followed by a two-week history of recurrent fever and cough with purulent sputum. Chest CT demonstrated multiple exudation of both lungs. He was diagnosed as community acquired pneumonia. Despite antibiotic combination therapy, abnormal chest shadows aggravated. Sputum and blood cultures were initially negative, but later blood culture grew VRE-fm. We suspected aspiration of gastrointestinal content induced by epilepsy as the most likely mechanism. The patient was successfully treated with a four-week course of linezolid according to the antibiotic susceptibility testing. Conclusions: Physicians should consider multi-drug resistant organisms such as VRE in uremic patients with pneumonia that fails to resolve with broad-spectrum antibiotics, especially in the cases with aspiration induced by epilepsy, immunocompromised conditions, and repeated or prolonged hospitalizations. \",\n\"Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium pneumonia in a uremic patient on hemodialysis: a case report and review of the literature[SEP]Background: Even though enterococci can cause serious infections in multiple sites, they are a rare cause of pneumonia.

As part of a larger investigation, we examined the cross-sectional associations between loneliness and a panel of both basal and LPS-stimulated inflammatory markers. Participants were 222 socioeconomically and racially diverse older adults (aged 70-90 years; 38% Black; 13% Hispanic) systematically recruited from the Bronx, NY. Loneliness was measured in two ways, with a retrospective trait measure (the UCLA Three Item Loneliness Scale) and an aggregated momentary measure assessed via ecological momentary assessment (EMA) across 14 days. Inflammatory markers included both basal levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and cytokines (IL-1\\u03b2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TNF-\\u03b1) and LPS-stimulated levels of the same cytokines. Multiple regression analyses controlled for age, body-mass index, race, and depressive symptoms. Moderation by gender and race were also explored. Both higher trait loneliness and aggregated momentary measures of loneliness were associated with higher levels of CRP (\\u03b2 = 0.16, p = 0.02; \\u03b2 = 0.15, p = 0.03, respectively).

Woods et al (Branlat, 2010) , have pointed out that it is difficult to find a satisfactory current methodology. They suggested that perhaps the Functional Resonance Analysis Methodology developed by Hollnagel (Hollnagel, 2012) could be an appropriate approach to try. In Part 1 this approach was employed to build an overall model of the UK's COVID 19 response management system, which was constructed as a framework against which, a series of more detailed analyses of specific health care responses could be examined. This meant being conscious of the bigger picture of simultaneous activities and the dynamic emergence of unexpected developments. At that stage, it was of necessity a model of \\\"work as imagined\\\" from careful official and speculative media sources. Although, a full rigorous application will require a more authenticated, official (peer reviewed?), set of data, reports and evidence statements, which doubtless will be available eventually from the inevitable Public Inquiry, it seems a pity to delay gaining and applying any insights and adaptations from \\\"work as (actually) done\\\", that have been observed to date. The recent select committee evidence from people at the heart of the system, (Committee, 2021), which may, or may not be corroborated later, nevertheless now provides a provisional database, which can be utilised to test whether the FRAM model can produce such insights from the actual performance of this highly complex system. This paper has thus attempted a trial run and has found that it can produce a plausible set of insights, which can explain how the system behaved in practice. With such a serious challenge to Government systems worldwide, in all their advisory, operation and decision-making functions, such insights although provisional, could usefully be incorporated and formalised in the current systems rather than waiting for inquiry endorsed recommendations to be formally considered perhaps some years into the future. The paper thus sets out a set of conclusions and recommendations, caveated by emphasising the lack of fully authenticated public domain data on which it is based. The main conclusion however is that the current system appears not to have included any of the functions which could have provided the adaptability and resilience required by fast moving emergencies, such as pandemics. The exception noted was the establishment of a parallel, independent vaccine development and delivery function and it is hoped that at least this lesson from the work as done could be recognised as providing the type of adaptability required and incorporated without delay. \",\n\"A systems analysis of the UK COVID 19 pandemic response: Part 2 -work as imagined vs work as done[SEP]Modelling complex sociotechnical systems to try to understand how observed behaviours emerge from a network of interacting, interdependent and interrelated functions is a major challenge.

To explore the effect of time span for the measures to be in force, two scenarios are invented, namely a long-term intervention and a short-term intervention, and predictions are made till the end of 2020 for all three countries under both scenarios. As a result, predictive patterns of the selected metrics for the three countries are rather different. China is predicted to have the mildest economic impact on the air transportation industry in this year in terms of air passenger revenue and air cargo traffic, provided that the control measures were prompt and effective. The U.S. would suffer from a far-reaching impact on the industry if the same control measures are maintained. More uncertainties are found for Singapore, as it is strongly associated with international travel demands.

Prior investigations have revealed 33 short-range host-switching events of PyVs in two different African bat species within the 34 horseshoe bat genus Rhinolophus. Herein, we have conducted a systematic investigation of PyVs 35 in 1,083 archived bat samples collected from five provinces across China, and identified 192 36 PyVs from 186 bats from 15 host species within 6 families (Rhinolophidae, Vespertilionidae, 37 Hipposideridae, Emballonuridae, Miniopteridae and Pteropodidae) representing 28 38 newly-described PyVs, indicative of extensive genetic diversity of bat PyVs. Surprisingly, two 39 PyVs were identified in multiple bat species from different families, and another PyV clustered 40 phylogenetically with PyVs carried by bats from a different host family, indicative of three 41 inter-family PyV host-switching events. The time to most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of 42 the three events was estimated at 0.02-11.6 million years ago (MYA), which is inconsistent with 43 the estimated tMRCA of their respective bat hosts (36.3-66.7 MYA), and is most parsimoniously 44 explained by host-switching events.

In this 56 study, we have identified multiple cases of host-switching events of PyVs by large scale 57 surveillance in diverse bat species collected in China. These host-switching events occurred 58 between bat families living in the same colony, indicating that a large population with frequent 59 contacts between different bat species may represent an ecological niche facilitating PyV 60 host-switching. The cases studied involved members of bats from several families, including 61 horseshoe bats, which were previously found to harbor a number of highly virulent viruses to 62 both humans and domestic animals. Our findings have provided evidence that even highly 63 host-specific DNA viruses can transmit between bats of different species and indicate an 64 increased propensity for spillover events involving horseshoe bats. We propose an evolutionary 65 scheme for bat-borne PyVs in which intra-host divergence and host-switching has generated the 66 diverse PyVs in present day bats.

Recent identification of diverse PyV-like sequences in different fish species 84 [17] and invertebrates (including arachnids and insects) has revealed a deep co-evolutionary 85 history of PyVs with their metazoan hosts [17].

Spillover of viruses from bats to humans or 76 domestic animals can give rise to outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases [10]. 77 Polyomaviruses (PyVs) are non-enveloped icosahedral DNA viruses containing a circular and 78 highly stable double-stranded DNA genome [11, 12]. PyVs can induce neoplastic transformation 79 in cell culture [12], and are associated with malignancy in humans [13, 14] and raccoons [15]. 80 Currently, 98 species carried by various mammals, birds and fish are recognized within the 81 family Polyomaviridae by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) and 82 classified into four separate genera (Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-and Deltapolyomavirus) with nine 83 floating species [16]. Recent identification of diverse PyV-like sequences in different fish species 84 [17] and invertebrates (including arachnids and insects) has revealed a deep co-evolutionary 85 history of PyVs with their metazoan hosts [17]. PyVs are highly host-specific in different 86 mammalian species, and long-range host jumps leading to productive infection and transmission 87 within mammalian genera are considered rare or nonexistent [17, 18]. Recently, an intra-host 88 divergence model with contributions from viral lineage duplication, recombination and, 89 potentially, host-switching at evolutionary timescales has been proposed to explain the extant 90 diversity based on the available genetic data [17]. .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/627158 doi: bioRxiv preprint 91 Currently, 15 alphapolyomaviruses and 10 betapolyomaviruses have been formally recognized 92 in insectivorous and frugivorous bat species within the Americas, Africa, Southeast Asia 93 (Indonesia) and the Pacific (New Zealand) [19-26]. These studies identified significant diversity 94 and high positive rates (10-20 %) using PCR-based approaches [27]. PyVs with complete or 95 partial genomes has also been identified by metagenomic analyses in bats collected in China and 96 recently from Saudi Arabia [28-30]. Investigation of PyVs in African insectivorous and 97 frugivorous bats [25, 26] has revealed evidence for short-range host-switching events of PyVs in 98 horseshoe bats (family Rhinolophidae, genus Rhinolophus) following identification of nearly 99 identical viruses (99.9% at the genomic level) in Rh. blasii and Rh. simulator [26]. 100 In the present study, we have characterized the diversity and genetic relationships of novel 101 PyVs from a large number of insectivorous and frugivorous bat samples collected in diverse 102 ecological environments in China, resulting in the identification of inter-family host-switching 103 events in these bat-borne PyVs. The findings challenge the prevailing paradigm of intra-host PyV 104 diversification in their mammalian hosts and extend the knowledge of PyV genetic diversity, 105 evolution, host restriction and host-switching. \"],\n [\"Journal Pre-proofs Computational biophysical characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding with the ACE2 receptor and implications for infectivity Computational biophysical characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding with the ACE2 receptor and implications for infectivity\",\n\"This is a PDF file of an article that has undergone enhancements after acceptance, such as the addition of a cover page and metadata, and formatting for readability, but it is not yet the definitive version of record.

Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf Abstract SARS-CoV-2 is a novel highly virulent pathogen which gains entry to human cells by binding with the cell surface receptorangiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2). We computationally contrasted the binding interactions between human ACE2 and coronavirus spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD) of the 2002 epidemic-causing SARS-CoV-1, SARS-CoV-2, and bat coronavirus RaTG13 using the Rosetta energy function. We find that the RBD of the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 is highly optimized to achieve very strong binding with human ACE2 (hACE2) which is consistent with its enhanced infectivity. SARS-CoV-2 forms the most stable complex with hACE2 compared to SARS-CoV-1 (23% less stable) or RaTG13 (11% less stable). Notably, we calculate that the SARS-CoV-2 RBD lowers the binding strength of angiotensin 2 receptor type I (ATR1) which is the native binding partner of ACE2 by 44.2%. Strong binding is mediated through strong electrostatic attachments with every fourth residue on the N-terminus alphahelix (starting from Ser19 to Asn53) as the turn of the helix makes these residues solvent accessible. By contrasting the spike protein SARS-CoV-2 Rosetta binding energy with ACE2 of different livestock and pet species we find strongest binding with bat ACE2 followed by human, feline, equine, canine and finally chicken. This is consistent with the hypothesis that bats are the viral origin and reservoir species. These results offer a computational explanation for the increased infection susceptibility by SARS-CoV-2 and allude to therapeutic modalities by identifying and rank-ordering the ACE2 residues involved in binding with the virus. \",\n\"Journal Pre-proofs Computational biophysical characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding with the ACE2 receptor and implications for infectivity Computational biophysical characterization of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein binding with the ACE2 receptor and implications for infectivity[SEP]This is a PDF file of an article that has undergone enhancements after acceptance, such as the addition of a cover page and metadata, and formatting for readability, but it is not yet the definitive version of record.

Currently there are no published studies investigating severe asthma and psychological comorbidity using arts-based methodology. We aimed to (i) illustrate the individual experience of adults living with severe asthma, with and without symptoms of depression and/or anxiety and (ii) to explore common characteristics depicted in artworks between those groups. Patients and Methods: A qualitative arts-based study was conducted. Adults with severe asthma were categorised into two groups according to Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale scores (<8 on either subscale [SA-D/A] (N=15) or (\\u22658 on one or both subscales [SA+D/A] (N=15). Art thematic analysis was undertaken using a hybrid approach. The Common-Sense Model of Self-Regulation was used to examine frequencies in artworks. Results: Participants with severe asthma alone and severe asthma with depression/anxiety were of older age (median 67 and 63 years respectively). There was greater asthma QoL impairment in participants with psychological comorbidity than without (4.7 \\u00b1 8.3 versus 5.8 \\u00b1 0.85, p=<0.01).

In vertebrates, H1 is a multigene family, which can encode up to 11 subtypes. The H1 subtype composition is different among cell types during the cell cycle and differentiation. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics has added a new layer of complexity with the identification of a large number of post-translational modifications (PTMs) in H1. In this review, we summarize histone H1 PTMs from lower eukaryotes to humans, with a particular focus on mammalian PTMs. Special emphasis is made on PTMs, whose molecular function has been described. Post-translational modifications in H1 have been associated with the regulation of chromatin structure during the cell cycle as well as transcriptional activation, DNA damage response, and cellular differentiation. Additionally, PTMs in histone H1 that have been linked to diseases such as cancer, autoimmune disorders, and viral infection are examined. Future perspectives and challenges in the profiling of histone H1 PTMs are also discussed. Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2020, 21, 5941 2 of 23 proteins and the CTD of metazoans, while the Saccharomyces cerevisiae version of H1, HhoI, contains a second winged-helix motif at its C-terminal end [7, 9] . However, it has been reported more recently that the high mobility group protein HMO1 functions as a linker histone in Saccharomyces cerevisiae [10] . In mammals, 11 H1 subtypes have been identified [11] . Subtypes H1.0-H1.5 and H1x are differentially expressed in somatic cells, while subtypes H1t, HILS1, and H1T2 are expressed in male germinal cells, and H1oo is expressed in oocytes [12] . Orthologous genes are readily identified across mammalian species, but they are rarely detected in moderately distant phyla. Mammalian H1 subtypes differ in their evolution velocities [7,13], expression patterns [12] , chromatin binding affinity [14] [15] [16] , and genomic distribution [17] [18] [19] [20] , among other features. The presence of post-translational modifications (PTMs) adds a new level of complexity to H1 diversity, as individual PTMs or their interplay can modulate protein structure and function. In this review, we present a comprehensive summary of the PTMs identified in H1, from lower eukaryotes to humans, focusing on those modifications with known biological function, or associated with disease. The first post-translational modification in H1 was described in the 70s, when phosphorylated H1 was identified in different species, throughout the tree of life. In a relatively short period, H1 phosphorylation was reported in protists such as Physarum polycephalum [21] and Tetrahymena sp. [22, 23] , and also in animals including Drosophila melanogaster [24], chicken erythrocytes [25], mammalian cell lines (rat hepatoma cells (HTC), and Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO)) [26, 27] . The identification of phosphorylation was carried out based on the changes in H1 electrophoretic mobility and on the incorporation of 32 P and/or phosphatase treatment. At the time, mapping the phosphate groups to individual residues was still elusive, and significant amounts of the modified protein were necessary for its detection. The development of mass spectrometry-based proteomics has represented a significant breakthrough in the identification of post-translational modifications, allowing mapping of PTMs to specific residues as well as the detection of low abundant modified species. There are three main types of proteomic strategies, depending on the molecule analyzed by mass spectrometry: top-down, middle-down, and bottom-up. Top-down proteomics analyzes intact proteins, while middle-down and bottom-up proteomics analyze large protein fragments/domains and small peptides, respectively [28] . PTM mapping and identification is mostly carried out by bottom-up proteomics. In this type of proteomic strategy, intact proteins are digested into small peptides, which are analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). During MS/MS, ionized peptides are selected in the first mass analyzer, fragmented, and the m/z of the product ions is determined in the second mass analyzer. Mass differences between product ions allow for peptide sequencing and PTM assignment. The availability of mass analyzers of high mass accuracy has allowed for the distinction between quasi-isobaric PTMs, trimethylation/acetylation, and dimethylation/formylation [29, 30] . Analysis of histone H1 PTMs by bottom-up proteomics has represented a technical challenge for two main reasons. First, H1 amino acid composition is characterized by a high content of lysine residues. Therefore, digestion with trypsin yields peptides that are relatively small and hydrophilic, which are difficult to detect by MS due to poor retention in the C18 Reverse-Phase Ion-Pairing High Performance Liquid Chromatography (RP-HPLC) column. As a result, regions with the highest density of lysine residues such as the CTD tend to have low coverage. This problem has been addressed by propionylation of amine groups in the protein (N-terminal amines, and free and monomethylated lysine \\u03b5-amino groups) before or after tryptic digestion [31, 32] . This modification has significantly improved the coverage of H1 by MS. The second challenging aspect is the presence in variable quantities of multiple subtypes or variants in higher eukaryotes. In particular, mammalian subtypes H1.1-H1.5 have more than 60% of sequence identity, and the sequence of the GD is almost identical [33] . Thus, many promiscuous peptides, matching the sequence of several subtypes, are often found in bottom-up studies. Several Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2020, 21, 5941 3 of 23 strategies have been used for the assignment of subtype-specific PTMs. Separation of individual subtypes before proteolytic digestion have been performed by capillary electrophoresis [34] and by 2D-electrophoresis. The latter used acetic-urea (AU) or triton-acetic-urea (TAU) electrophoresis in the first dimension, and Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate PolyAcrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) in the second dimension [35] [36] [37] . Combining bottom-up and top-down proteomics has also been used to assign PTMs to individual subtypes [31, [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] . Bottom-up proteomics has identified and mapped a wide variety of PTMs in several eukaryotes (summarized in Tables S1-S3).

Main body: Chest CT scan can play a key diagnostic role in COVID-19 patients. Additionally, it can be useful to monitor imaging changes during treatment. However, CT scan overuse during the COVID-19 pandemic raises concerns about radiation-induced adverse effects, both in patients and healthcare workers. Conclusion: By evaluating the CT scanning parameters used in several studies, one can find the necessity for optimizing these parameters. It has been found that chest CT scan taken using low-dose CT protocol is a reliable diagnostic tool to detect COVID-19 pneumonia in daily practice. Moreover, the low-dose chest CT protocol results in a remarkable reduction (up to 89%) in the radiation dose compared to the standard-dose protocol, not lowering diagnostic accuracy of COVID-19-induced pneumonia in CT images. Therefore, its employment in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic is highly recommended. \",\n\"A review on chest CT scanning parameters implemented in COVID-19 patients: bringing low-dose CT protocols into play[SEP]Background: This study aims to review chest computed tomography (CT) scanning parameters which are utilized to evaluate patients for COVID-19-induced pneumonia.

Thus, accurate immunization histories are critical. Many providers rely on patient self-report when assessing immunization status. The primary aim of our study was to determine the accuracy of self-reported influenza vaccination status in a cohort of patients with IBD. Methods We conducted a prospective study of patients with IBD who answered a vaccination status questionnaire and compared their responses to the Wisconsin Immunization Registry, a state-wide electronic immunization information system. The primary outcome was the sensitivity and specificity of self-reported influenza vaccination status. A secondary outcome evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of pneumococcal vaccination status. Results A total of 200 patients with IBD were included in the study. Documented immunization rates were 74.5% for influenza vaccinations and 79.9% for pneumococcal vaccinations. Influenza vaccination self-report had a sensitivity of 98.7%, a specificity of 90.2%, a positive predictive value (PPV) of 96.7% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 95.8%. In comparison, the sensitivity for pneumococcal vaccination was 83.5% with a specificity of 86.2%, PPV of 96.4%, and NPV of 54.3%. Conclusions Self-reported influenza immunization status is sensitive and specific in patients with IBD. Accuracy for pneumococcal vaccination is slightly lower, but responses were notable for a high PPV. Self-report is an effective way to determine influenza immunization status and provides useful information for receipt of pneumococcal vaccine in patients with IBD. \",\n\"Accuracy of Self-Reported Vaccination Status in a Cohort of Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease[SEP]Background and Aims Prevention of vaccine-preventable diseases is important in the care of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

In their correspondence, the Authors raised two important issues, namely the possible association between tuberculosis (TB) and COVID-19 (can infection by SARS-CoV-2 reactivate TB?) and the effects of TB on early mortality in co-infected patients. Our research letter reported the first cohort of patients with diagnosis of TB (including posttreatment sequelae) and COVID-19. The article was aimed at reporting what was observed at the beginning of the epidemic among some of the most affected countries. This explains the small numbers described and the countries involved. At the time the article was submitted several countries in Africa, Europe and Latin America represented in the Global Tuberculosis Network (GTN) had no TB/COVID-19 patients to report. In the absence of previous cohorts and scientific information on the TB/COVID-19 coinfection, we have described the timing of diagnosis of the two diseases, observing that one third had COVID-19 diagnosed prior to TB and 18% were diagnosed simultaneously. We agree, it is possible that the diagnosis of COVID was made before TB because of acute onset of symptoms caused by SARS-CoV2 in addition to the alarm generated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which determined rapid access to radiological examinations and subsequent discovery of underlying tuberculosis. In fact we commented this in point 3 of our article [2], and we abstained from making any clear statement about causal association. However, we could not exclude that the infection by SARS-CoV-2 or the drugs utilized might have accelerated the progression of a pre-existing TB infection to disease. However, apart from the speculation on what disease comes first, it is evident that the coexistence of TB and COVID-19 poses a challenge in differential diagnosis [2]. The study was observational, and based on a relatively small cohort, and therefore we fully agree that larger prospective studies are necessary to shed further light on this to establish whether there is an association or not. The Authors [1] also raised the important question whether TB has a real effect or 'weight' in increasing the probability of death in COVID-19 patients. The issue has been described in a second article [3] which reports the findings of 69 patients from our original cohort plus a second cohort [4] which was managed in a reference hospital in Northern Italy. The patients likelier to die were those of older age with pre-existing co-morbidities [3] . It is important to emphasise that the cohort of young migrants without co-morbidities reported elsewhere [3,4] experienced a milder form of COVID-19 with no deaths. However, in countries where risk factors for mortality are highly prevalent among young individuals (smoking, alcohol and substance abuse, HIV co-infection, among others), particularly in the presence of drug-resistance and difficult access to diagnosis (delayed diagnosis), the impact of mortality may be higher. We agree that in resource-limited settings poverty and malnutrition might play an important role in increasing morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, we do agree that the population of individuals with post-TB treatment sequelae deserves further evaluation, given the potential effect of both TB and COVID-19 on quality of life and subsequent need for rehabilitation [5] [6] [7] . In order to better understand the implication of TB and COVID-19 co-infection the study is continuing: more countries and a larger sample size will help answering some of the questions left open by our original study [2] . We will be happy to collaborate with all interested colleagues. \",\n\"Early View Correspondence On Tuberculosis and COVID-19 co-infection On Tuberculosis and COVID-19 co-infection[SEP]Text 572 words Dear Editor, we wish to thank, Alkesh Khurana and Deepak Aggarwal [1] for their interest in our research letter and comments [1] .

We therefore studied changes in dispensing of colonoscopy preparations during the pandemic in France. Methods Using the French national health data system, we identified colonoscopy preparations dispensed from 2018 to 2020. The expected 2020 dispensations were estimated from 2018 to 2019 dispensations. Results Dispensing of colonoscopy preparations decreased markedly during the eight weeks of national lockdown: 83,045 colonoscopy preparations were dispensed, i.e., 181,826 (68.6%) fewer than expected. After lockdown, dispensing of colonoscopy preparations gradually returned to expected numbers. Overall, this represents an estimated decrease of roughly 250,000 colonoscopy preparations during the six-month period following onset of the pandemic. This shortfall in the dispensing of colonoscopy preparations was of the same order of magnitude in people under or over 50 years of age, in men and women, and in those in the highest and the lowest quintiles of the deprivation index. Conclusion In conclusion, roughly 250,000 fewer colonoscopy preparations were dispensed during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic in France. Deleterious consequences on morbidity and mortality related to gastroenterological diseases, such as colorectal cancer, are to be feared. \",\n\"Colonoscopy in France during the COVID-19 pandemic[SEP]Purpose We hypothesized that the COVID-19 pandemic may have modified dispensing of colonoscopy preparations, a proxy for the number of colonoscopies performed.

We quantified excess mortality in regions of England and Wales during the pandemic, for all causes and for non-COVID-19-associated deaths. England and Wales were obtained from the Office of National Statistics. Mean-dispersion negative binomial regressions were used to model death counts based on pre-pandemic trends and exponentiated linear predictions were subtracted from: (i) all-cause deaths and (ii) all-cause deaths minus COVID-19 related deaths for the pandemic period (week starting 7 March, to week ending 8 May). Findings Between 7 March and 8 May 2020, there were 47 243 (95% CI: 46 671 to 47 815) excess deaths in England and Wales, of which 9948 (95% CI: 9376 to 10 520) were not associated with COVID-19. Overall excess mortality rates varied from 49 per 100 000 (95% CI: 49 to 50) in the South West to 102 per 100 000 (95% CI: 102 to 103) in London.

Since working memory is a limited-capacity system, there should be a trade-off between available resources and the aesthetic experience. To test whether the intensity of the aesthetic experience is reduced if working memory resources are otherwise occupied, we employed an experience sampling method. One hundred and fifteen undergraduate students (45% female; M age = 23.50 years, SD = 2.72 years) participated in a 2week experience sampling study and furnished a total of 15,047 reports of their aesthetic experiences. As measures of current working memory resources, participants answered questions regarding their current working memory load and whether they were engaged in a second task. In addition, they reported whether they had had an aesthetic experience and how much they had savored the aesthetic experience. Multilevel modeling was used for data analysis. A higher working memory load was associated with fewer aesthetic experiences and reduced the savoring of aesthetic experiences. Second tasks, however, that were perceived as demanding and requiring a lot of concentration enhanced the savoring of aesthetic experiences. In sum, other goal-oriented behavior that requires working memory resources appears to conflict with aesthetic experiences in everyday life.

This method can complete the sample detection at 39\\u00b0C in 30 min. In this study, we successfully established a rapid reverse transcription recombinase-aided amplification (RT-RAA) assay for the detection of human norovirus GII.4 and applied this assay to clinical samples, as well as comparison with commercial reverse transcription real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Results: At 95% probability, the detection sensitivity of RT-RAA was 3.425 log10 genomic copies (LGC)/reaction. Moreover, no cross-reaction was observed with other norovirus genogroups and other common foodborne viruses. Stool samples were examined by RT-RAA and reverse transcription quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Compared of RT-qPCR, kappa values for human norovirus detection with RT-RAA were 0.894 (p < 0.001), indicating that both assays were in agreement.

We sought to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 in the overall screening for acute stroke utilizing a commercial clinical artificial intelligence platform. Data were derived from the Viz Platform, an artificial intelligence application designed to optimize the workflow of patients with acute stroke. Neuroimaging data on suspected patients with stroke across 97 hospitals in 20 US states were collected in real time and retrospectively analyzed with the number of patients undergoing imaging screening serving as a surrogate for the amount of stroke care. The main outcome measures were the number of computed tomography (CT) angiography, CT perfusion, large vessel occlusions (defined according to the automated software detection), and severe strokes on CT perfusion (defined as those with hypoperfusion volumes >70 mL) normalized as number of patients per day per hospital. Data from the prepandemic (November 4, 2019 to February 29, 2020) and pandemic (March 1 to May 10, 2020) periods were compared at national and state levels. Correlations were made between the inter-period changes in imaging screening, stroke hospitalizations, and thrombectomy procedures using state-specific sampling. A total of 23 223 patients were included. The incidence of large vessel occlusion on CT angiography and severe strokes on CT perfusion were 11.2% (n=2602) and 14.7% (n=1229/8328), respectively. There were significant declines in the overall number of CT angiographies (\\u221222.8%; 1.39-1.07 patients/day per hospital, P<0.001) and CT perfusion (\\u221226.1%; 0.50-0.37 patients/day per hospital, P<0.001) as well as in the incidence of large vessel occlusion (\\u221217.1%; 0.15-0.13 patients/day per hospital, P<0.001) and severe strokes on CT perfusion (\\u221216.7%; 0.12-0.10 patients/day per hospital, P<0.005). The sampled cohort showed similar declines in the rates of large vessel occlusions versus thrombectomy (18.8% versus 19.5%, P=0.9) and comprehensive stroke center hospitalizations (18.8% versus 11.0%, P=0.4).

Data from the prepandemic (November 4, 2019 to February 29, 2020) and pandemic (March 1 to May 10, 2020) periods were compared at national and state levels. Correlations were made between the inter-period changes in imaging screening, stroke hospitalizations, and thrombectomy procedures using state-specific sampling. A total of 23 223 patients were included. The incidence of large vessel occlusion on CT angiography and severe strokes on CT perfusion were 11.2% (n=2602) and 14.7% (n=1229/8328), respectively. There were significant declines in the overall number of CT angiographies (\\u221222.8%; 1.39-1.07 patients/day per hospital, P<0.001) and CT perfusion (\\u221226.1%; 0.50-0.37 patients/day per hospital, P<0.001) as well as in the incidence of large vessel occlusion (\\u221217.1%; 0.15-0.13 patients/day per hospital, P<0.001) and severe strokes on CT perfusion (\\u221216.7%; 0.12-0.10 patients/day per hospital, P<0.005). The sampled cohort showed similar declines in the rates of large vessel occlusions versus thrombectomy (18.8% versus 19.5%, P=0.9) and comprehensive stroke center hospitalizations (18.8% versus 11.0%, P=0.4). CONCLUSIONS: A significant decline in stroke imaging screening has occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. This analysis underscores the broader application of artificial intelligence neuroimaging platforms for the real-time monitoring of stroke systems of care. \"],\n [\"PEER REVIEW HISTORY\",\n\"BMJ Open publishes all reviews undertaken for accepted manuscripts.

Clues may lie with the predisposition to hypoxemia or unexpected absence of dyspnea ('silent hypoxemia') in some patients who later develop respiratory failure. Using a recently-validated breath-holding technique, we sought to test the hypothesis that gas exchange and ventilatory control deficits observed at admission are associated with subsequent adverse COVID-19 outcomes (composite primary outcome: non-invasive ventilatory support, intensive care admission, or death). Patients with COVID-19 (N = 50) performed breath-holds to obtain measurements reflecting the predisposition to oxygen desaturation (mean desaturation after 20-s) and reduced chemosensitivity to hypoxic-hypercapnia (including maximal breath-hold duration). Associations with the primary composite outcome were modeled adjusting for baseline oxygen saturation, obesity, sex, age, and prior cardiovascular disease. Healthy controls (N = 23) provided a normative comparison. The adverse composite outcome (observed in N = 11/50) was associated with breath-holding measures at admission (likelihood ratio test, p = 0.020); specifically, greater mean desaturation (12-fold greater odds of adverse composite outcome with 4% compared with 2% desaturation, p = 0.002) and greater maximal breath-holding duration (2.7-fold greater odds per 10-s increase, p = 0.036). COVID-19 patients who did not develop the adverse composite outcome had similar mean desaturation to healthy controls. Breath-holding offers a novel method to identify patients with high risk of respiratory failure in COVID-19. Greater breath-hold induced desaturation (gas exchange deficit) and greater breath-holding tolerance (ventilatory control deficit) may be independent harbingers of progression to severe disease. \",\n\"Breath-holding as a novel approach to risk stratification in COVID-19[SEP]Background: Despite considerable progress, it remains unclear why some patients admitted for COVID-19 develop adverse outcomes while others recover spontaneously.

Method: To this end, three bat species (Eidolon helvum, Carollia perspicillata and Tadarida brasiliensis) of lung epithelial cells were separately infected with two avian and two human influenza viruses to determine their relative host innate immune resistance to infection. Results: All three species of bat cells were more resistant than positive control Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells to all four influenza viruses. TB1-Lu cells lacked sialic acid \\u03b12,6-Gal receptors and were most resistant among the three bat species. Interestingly, avian viruses were relatively more replication permissive in all three bat species of cells than with the use of human viruses which suggest that bats could potentially play a role in the ecology of avian influenza viruses. Chemical inhibition of the JAK-STAT pathway in bat cells had no effect on virus production suggesting that type I interferon signalling is not a major factor in resisting influenza virus infection. Conclusion: Although all three species of bat cells are relatively more resistant to influenza virus infection than control MDCK cells, they are more permissive to avian than human viruses which suggest that bats could have a contributory role in the ecology of avian influenza viruses. \",\n\"Bat lung epithelial cells show greater host species-specific innate resistance than MDCK cells to human and avian influenza viruses[SEP]Background: With the recent discovery of novel H17N10 and H18N11 influenza viral RNA in bats and report on high frequency of avian H9 seroconversion in a species of free ranging bats, an important issue to address is the extent bats are susceptible to conventional avian and human influenza A viruses.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis is a seasonal disease that has an enormous burden on health systems across the world. RSV disease manifestations in children range from mild upper respiratory tract infections to severe lower respiratory tract infections, including pneumonia and bronchiolitis. In South Africa, the seasonality of RSV disease causing both upper and lower respiratory tract illness is well documented. Objectives. To describe the incidence of RSV bronchiolitis among patients \\u226424 months of age who presented to a tertiary institution with a diagnosed viral bronchiolitis over a 4-year period. Secondary aims included determining: (i) the risk factors for the development of RSV bronchiolitis; (ii) the fatality rates and risk factors associated with mortality; (iii) the correlation with c-reactive protein values and risk of comorbid bacterial infection; and (iv) the impact of seasonality on RSV incidence. Methods. A retrospective chart-based analysis of laboratory-confirmed RSV cases in children \\u226424 months, presenting to Steve Biko Academic Hospital from January 2013 to December 2016, was undertaken. Epidemiology, risk factors and local weather data were collected as part of the analysis. Results. During the 4-year period, a total of 1 127 nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) was collected. RSV was isolated from 162 NPAs by either immunofluorescence (84%) or polymerase chain reaction (16%). Of the 162 patients with RSV bronchiolitis, 131 (80.9%) had a known HIV status. Only 2 (1.5%) of the patients whose status was known were HIV-infected; 26 (19.8%) were HIV-exposed and confirmed negative; and 103 (78.6%) HIV-unexposed. Forty-nine patients (30.2%) with RSV required intensive care unit (ICU, either paediatric or neonatal) admission. Thirty-four (69.4%) of these were <6 months old. Prematurity (27.8%) and cardiac lesions (13%) were the most common risk factors for acquiring the disease identified in patients with RSV bronchiolitis. Conclusions. RSV is still a commonly detected virus among infants who are admitted for bronchiolitis. Significant risk factors associated with admission due to RSV bronchiolitis were prematurity, being <6 months of age and congenital cardiac disease. Male gender and HIV status did not appear to increase the risk of RSV bronchiolitis. In fact, HIV seems to have a protective effect against specifically RSV bronchiolitis in children <2 years of age. Young babies, especially premature infants with RSV bronchiolitis, are at considerable risk of requiring ICU admission, which leads to a significant increase in admission costs. \",\n\"The epidemiology of respiratory syncytial virus: A retrospective review from Steve Biko Academic Hospital 2013 -2016[SEP]Background.

The framework is made up of two pairs of linked concepts: 1) Susceptibility or the chance of an individual becoming infected; 2) Resistance or the ability of an individual to avoid infection; 3) Vulnerability or the likelihood of significant impacts occurring at individual, household or community level; and 4) Resilience: the active responses that enable people to avoid the worst impacts of an epidemic at different levels or to recover faster to a level accepted as normal. This framework allows the clear formulation of key questions for COVID-19: factors in the labor process itself that make people more or less susceptible; broader socio-economic and biophysical determinants of susceptibility; factors that make farm households, food enterprises and value chains more vulnerable to the impacts of the pandemic; and aspects of COVID-19 responses by governments and the private sector that might increase vulnerability. Brief examples of susceptibility of value chain operations and of their vulnerability to COVID-19 lockdown measures are given. A focus on resistance and resilience encourages investigation of local-level responses by communities and NGOs, which with appropriate monitoring and learning could be scaled up. The full impacts of COVID-19 on the global South are yet to be seen, and are still hard to predict in either scale or nature. This applies to infection, morbidity and mortality rates, and still more so to downstream effects on sectors like agriculture and agricultural trade. Yet it is clear that those effects will include impacts on both smallholder and commercial farming and on other links in agricultural value chains. At the same time, news from countries of the North suggests another causal relationship, that particular sorts of enterprises within agricultural value chains, most prominently meat-processing plants, are implicated in localized COVID-19 outbreaks, some of them extremely serious (Reuben 2020 citing cases in UK, Germany, France, Spain and the US). The great majority of reports on impacts already experienced in different countries of the South still concern the indirect impacts of lockdowns and travel bans, or of economic trends in more industrialized countries. To take a few examples: \\uf0b7 In Zimbabwe, rural people's lives have been \\\"massively\\\" affected by movement restrictions, shutdowns of agricultural produce markets and lack of access to agricultural inputs (such as veterinary supplies) and services (such as pump repair) (Scoones 2020). \\uf0b7 In East Africa, exports of coffee, tea, fresh produce and cut flowers have been shut down, both by closing down of auctions as mass gatherings, and weakening demand on world markets (RBN 2020).

In this study, we evaluated four classifiers built to predict Hyperchloremia-a condition that often results from aggressive fluids administration in the ICU population-and compared their performance in racial, gender, and insurance subgroups. We observed that adding social determinants features in addition to the lab-based ones improved model performance on all patients. The subgroup testing yielded significantly different AUC scores in 40 out of the 44 model-subgroup, suggesting disparities when applying ML models to social determinants subgroups.

The subgroup testing yielded significantly different AUC scores in 40 out of the 44 model-subgroup, suggesting disparities when applying ML models to social determinants subgroups. We urge future researchers to design models that proactively adjust for potential biases and include subgroup reporting in their studies. \"],\n [\"Loss of orf3b in the circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains\",\n\"The newly emerged betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, causes the COVID-19 pandemic since December 2019 with more than 35 million laboratory confirmed human infections and over one million deaths within nine months. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve during the global transmission with the notable emergence of the spike D614G substitution that enhances infectivity. Some of these viral adaptations may alter not only the infectivity but also viral pathogenesis. Continuous phylogenomic analysis of circulating viral strains and functional investigation of new non-synonymous substitutions may help to understand the evolution of virus, its virulence and transmissibility. Here we describe a loss of an accessory protein orf3b (57 amino acids) in current circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains, contributing around 24% of more than 100,000 complete viral genomes analysed. The loss of 3b is caused by the presence of an early stop codon which is created by an orf3a Q57H substitution. There is an increasing trend in the loss of orf3b which has reached 32% in May 2020. Geographically, loss of 3b is more prevalent in certain countries including Colombia (46%), USA (48%), South Korea (51%), France (66%), Saudi Arabia (72%), Finland (76%) and Egypt (77%). Interestingly, the loss of 3b coincides with the emergence of spike D614G substitution. In addition, we found that truncated orf3b has lost the interferon antagonism compared to the full-length orf3b, suggesting a loss of function by the newly adapted virus. Further investigation of orf3b deletion and spike D614G substitution on virulence and infectivity respectively will provide important insights into SARS-CoV-2 evolution. \",\n\"Loss of orf3b in the circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains[SEP]The newly emerged betacoronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, causes the COVID-19 pandemic since December 2019 with more than 35 million laboratory confirmed human infections and over one million deaths within nine months.

Previous works assumed either no or very low corruption. Our method trains a robust variational autoencoder (VAE), which aims to generate a model for the uncorrupted training points. To gain robustness to corruption, we incorporate three changes to the common VAE: 1. Modeling the latent distribution as a mixture of Gaussian inliers and outliers, while using only the inlier component when testing; 2. Applying the Wasserstein-1 metric for regularization, instead of Kullback-Leibler divergence; and 3. Using a least absolute deviation error for reconstruction, which is equivalent to assuming a heavy-tailed likelihood. We illustrate state-of-the-art results on standard benchmark datasets for novelty detection. * Equal contribution. Preprint.

The disease was first detected in Wuhan, the capital of China's Hubei province, in December 2019 and has since spread globally, especially to Europe and North America, resulting in the ongoing global coronavirus pandemic disaster of 2019-2020. Although most cases have mild symptoms, there is some progression to viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure and death. More than 4.6 million cases have been registered across 216 countries and territories as of 19 April 2020, resulting in more than 311,000 deaths. Risk to communities with continued widespread disease transmission depends on characteristics of the virus, including how well it spreads between people; the severity of resulting illness; and the medical or other measures available to control the impact of the virus (for example, vaccines or medications that can treat the illness) and the relative success of these. In the absence of vaccines or medications, non-pharmaceutical interventions were the most important response strategy based on community interventions such as person-to-person distancing, mask-wearing, isolation and good personal hygiene (hand-washing)-all of which have been demonstrated can reduce the impact of this seemingly unstoppable globally spreading natural disaster. This paper presents the results of quantitative research regarding the level of citizen preparedness for disasters caused by coronavirus disease in Serbia. The survey was conducted using a questionnaire that was requested and then collected online among 975 respondents during disaster in April 2020. The questionnaire examined citizens' basic socio-economic and demographic characteristics, their knowledge, preparedness, risk perception and preventive measures taken individually and as a community to prevent the death and widespread transmission of novel coronavirus disease 2019 in the Republic of Serbia. Based on the findings that there are major differences in the public's perception of risks posed by communicable disease threats such as presented by COVID-19, emergency management agencies should use these differences to develop targeted strategies to enhance community and national preparedness by promoting behavioral change and improving risk management decision-making. \",\n\"Preparedness and Preventive Behaviors for a Pandemic Disaster Caused by COVID-19 in Serbia[SEP]Coronavirus disease 2019 is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

The immune activities of the central nervous system are profoundly affected by peripheral immune activities. Immune tolerance refers to the unresponsiveness of the immune system to continuous or repeated stimulation to avoid excessive inflammation and unnecessary by-stander injury in the face of continuous antigen threat. It has been proved that the immune tolerance could suppress the development of various peripheral inflammation-related diseases. However, the role of immune tolerance in neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative diseases was not clear. Methods: Rats were injected with repeated low-dose lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 0.3 mg/kg) intraperitoneally for 4 days to induce peripheral immune tolerance. Neuroinflammation was produced using intracranial LPS (15 \\u03bcg) injection. Inflammation cytokines were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Microglial activation were measured using immunostaining of Iba-1 and ED-1. Dopaminergic neuronal damage was evaluated using immunochemistry staining and stereological counting of TH-positive neurons. Behavioral impairment was evaluated using amphetamine-induced rotational behavioral assessment. Results: Compared with the non-immune tolerated animals, pre-treatment of peripheral immune tolerance significantly decreased the production of inflammatory cytokines, suppressed the microglial activation, and increased the number of dopaminergic neuronal survival in the substantia nigra. Conclusions: Our results indicated that peripheral immune tolerance attenuated neuroinflammation and inhibited neuroinflammation-induced dopaminergic neuronal death. \",\n\"Peripheral immune tolerance alleviates the intracranial lipopolysaccharide injection- induced neuroinflammation and protects the dopaminergic neurons from neuroinflammation-related neurotoxicity[SEP]Background: Neuroinflammation plays a critical role in the onset and development of neurodegeneration disorders such as Parkinson's disease.

Our study fills this gap by conducting a nationwide survey in China between 12 and 25 February (2020), and a follow-up survey targeting the same participants between 25 and 28 March (2020). We have discovered that perceived increased time staying at home, a subjective agency for social distancing, positively predicts not only risk perception of COVID-19 epidemic at the outbreak and eased stage, but also predicts subjective controllability of COVID-19 epidemic at the eased stage. Given that risk perception indicates potential active engagement of preventative behavior and that subjective controllability associating with selfefficacy could promote individual health behavior, this study preliminarily justifies the value of social distancing from the angle of perceptual factors, adding to existing mounting evidence of its effect on physically controlling pandemic spread. \",\n\"More than just a mental stressor: psychological value of social distancing in COVID-19 mitigation through increased risk perception-a preliminary study in China[SEP]Social distancing is an effective measure to prevent epidemic infections during a pandemic outbreak, but its psychological value in COVID-19 pandemic mitigation remained less detected.

Methods All emergency medical services (EMS) transports for chest pain or out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) in the Dutch region Hollands-Midden (population served > 800,000) were evaluated during the initial 6 weeks of the COVID-19 lockdown and during the same time period in 2019. The primary endpoint was the number of evaluated chest pain patients in both cohorts. In addition, the number of EMS evaluations of ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and OHCA were assessed. Results During the COVID-19 lockdown period, the EMS evaluated 927 chest pain patients (49% male, age 62 \\u00b1 17 years) compared with 1041 patients (51% male, 63 \\u00b1 17 years) in the same period in 2019, which corresponded with a significant relative risk (RR) reduction of 0.88 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81-0.96).

According to interdependence theory, couples who approach behavior change as a problem to be tackled together versus independently are more likely to utilize communal coping processes to promote behavior change. We utilized interdependence theory to develop a partner-assisted intervention to increase long-term weight loss. Methods: Community-dwelling individuals (index participants) cohabitating with a partner with 1) overweight and at least one obesity-related comorbidity or 2) obesity are randomized to participate in a standard weight management program alone or with their partner.

Behavioral factors and lifestyle variables may also contribute to different food dietary trends. In this way, the present study intended to investigate the consumption habits of the most relevant types of dairy products around the world and relate them to sociodemographic factors, for example, age, sex, education and country as well as with some anthropometric and behavioral aspects, for example, body mass index, satisfaction with body weight and exercise or sedentary lifestyles. One other objective of the study was to categorize the lifestyles of the participants, according to measured variables linked with hours of inactivity or exercise, in order to use these as possible differentiating variables for the consumption of dairy products. The study involved a questionnaire survey undertaken on a non-probabilistic convenience sample of participants from Portugal (PT) and Brazil (BR), and participation was voluntary and anonymous. The data analysis involved different statistical techniques: basic statistics, chi-square tests, factor analysis, cluster analysis and tree classification analysis. The results showed that semi skimmed milk is never consumed by about half of the participants (47.4% for PT and 46.7 for BR), and those numbers increase for skimmed (64.8% for PT and 50.9% for BR), chocolate flavored milk (82.6% for PT and 65.6% for BR) and enriched milks (94.8% for PT and 85.3% for BR). Cheeses are also consumed in the two countries by small numbers of people. The number of participants consuming imported cheeses in both countries was particularly low (only 4.0% consume these more than once a week in both countries), suggesting national products may be preferred. It was further observed that those who consume cheese do it seldom (once a week) or sometimes (2-3 times per week). Butter is also consumed by only about half of the adult population (43.8% for PT and 49.5% for BR), but the percentage of those who never consume butter increases for skimmed butter (66.0% for PT and 82.6% for BR) and unsalted butter (70.2% for PT and 69.1% for BR). The consumption of yogurts also follows similar low consumption patterns. The most frequently consumed yogurt types in Portugal are liquid (30.5% consume regularly) and natural yogurts (34.8% consume regularly), while in Brazil the most frequent are creamy fruit pulp yogurt (14.4% consume regularly), liquid (13.7% consume regularly) and Greek type yogurt (10.2% consume regularly). A factor analysis and a cluster analysis established groups according to lifestyles, as follows: 1-Screeners, 2-Exercisers, 3-Travelers and 4-Others. These lifestyles were found to be influential in the consumption of dairy products for all classes of dairy tested: milk, cheese, yogurt and butter. For example, the screeners were found to consume more milk, more butter, more cheese and more yogurt. Additionally, other influential factors were age, sex, education, BMI and satisfaction with body weight.

The results concluded that, despite some small differences in the patterns of consumption of dairy products in both countries, the levels of consumption of dairy products are extremely low, for all classes studied (milk, cheese, yogurt or butter). Additionally, it was concluded that some factors are influential on the level of consumption of dairy products, and therefore decision makers can plan their interventions according to the characteristics of the targeted segments of the population, according to lifestyle, age, sex, education, BMI and satisfaction with body weight. \",\n\"Study of the Influence of Sociodemographic and Lifestyle Factors on Consumption of Dairy Products: Preliminary Study in Portugal and Brazil[SEP]Sociodemographic characteristics, including regional variations, have been associated with different food consumption patterns. Behavioral factors and lifestyle variables may also contribute to different food dietary trends. In this way, the present study intended to investigate the consumption habits of the most relevant types of dairy products around the world and relate them to sociodemographic factors, for example, age, sex, education and country as well as with some anthropometric and behavioral aspects, for example, body mass index, satisfaction with body weight and exercise or sedentary lifestyles. One other objective of the study was to categorize the lifestyles of the participants, according to measured variables linked with hours of inactivity or exercise, in order to use these as possible differentiating variables for the consumption of dairy products. The study involved a questionnaire survey undertaken on a non-probabilistic convenience sample of participants from Portugal (PT) and Brazil (BR), and participation was voluntary and anonymous. The data analysis involved different statistical techniques: basic statistics, chi-square tests, factor analysis, cluster analysis and tree classification analysis. The results showed that semi skimmed milk is never consumed by about half of the participants (47.4% for PT and 46.7 for BR), and those numbers increase for skimmed (64.8% for PT and 50.9% for BR), chocolate flavored milk (82.6% for PT and 65.6% for BR) and enriched milks (94.8% for PT and 85.3% for BR). Cheeses are also consumed in the two countries by small numbers of people. The number of participants consuming imported cheeses in both countries was particularly low (only 4.0% consume these more than once a week in both countries), suggesting national products may be preferred. It was further observed that those who consume cheese do it seldom (once a week) or sometimes (2-3 times per week). Butter is also consumed by only about half of the adult population (43.8% for PT and 49.5% for BR), but the percentage of those who never consume butter increases for skimmed butter (66.0% for PT and 82.6% for BR) and unsalted butter (70.2% for PT and 69.1% for BR). The consumption of yogurts also follows similar low consumption patterns. The most frequently consumed yogurt types in Portugal are liquid (30.5% consume regularly) and natural yogurts (34.8% consume regularly), while in Brazil the most frequent are creamy fruit pulp yogurt (14.4% consume regularly), liquid (13.7% consume regularly) and Greek type yogurt (10.2% consume regularly). A factor analysis and a cluster analysis established groups according to lifestyles, as follows: 1-Screeners, 2-Exercisers, 3-Travelers and 4-Others. These lifestyles were found to be influential in the consumption of dairy products for all classes of dairy tested: milk, cheese, yogurt and butter. For example, the screeners were found to consume more milk, more butter, more cheese and more yogurt. Additionally, other influential factors were age, sex, education, BMI and satisfaction with body weight. Nevertheless, country was not a meaningfully discriminant variable in relation to the other variables included in the classification Foods 2020, 9, 1775 2 of 28 analysis.

This study addresses the possibility of developing a challenge prediction-based method for optimizing a reliable and affordable hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) to aid with energy challenges associated with pandemic conditions. The results indicate that the PV/diesel/battery hybrid system with a maximum energy cost of $0.141/kWh and a renewable fraction of more than 50% can meet demand even during the most severe load jumps. Furthermore, the fuel constraints during pandemic years can increase the energy costs up to 2.5 times, and the required photovoltaic installation capacity by about four times. Due to the 20.1% PV output boost, Vertical-axis tracking systems are recommended in areas with limited PV installation space.

Is Amyloid Fibrillation Related to 3D Domain Swapping for the C-Terminal Domain of SARS-CoV Main Protease?\",\n\"The C-terminal domain of SARS-CoV main protease (M pro -C) can form 3D domainswapped dimer by exchanging the \\uf061 1 -helices fully buried inside the protein hydrophobic core, under non-denaturing conditions. Here, we report that M pro -C can also form amyloid fibrils under the 3D domain-swappable conditions in vitro, and the fibrils are not formed through runaway/propagated domain swapping. It is found that there are positive correlations between the rates of domain swapping dimerization and amyloid fibrillation at different temperatures, and for different mutants. However, some M pro -C mutants incapable of 3D domain swapping can still form amyloid fibrils, indicating that 3D domain swapping is not essential for amyloid fibrillation. Furthermore, NMR H/D exchange data and molecular dynamics simulation results suggest that the protofibril core region tends to unpack at the early stage of 3D domain swapping, so that the amyloid fibrillation can proceed during the 3D domain swapping process. We propose that 3D domain swapping makes it possible for the unpacking of the amyloidogenic fragment of the protein and thus accelerates the amyloid fibrillation process kinetically, which explains the well-documented correlations between amyloid fibrillation and 3D domain swapping observed in many proteins. Domain swapping, better defined as three-dimensional (3D) domain swapping, was first introduced by Eisenberg and his colleagues to describe the crystal structure of dimeric diphtheria toxin [1].

The fractions of these samples were taken out at different time points and put on ice to stop the interconversion and polymerization processes. Mass percentages of the M pro -C monomer, domain-swapped dimer, and polymer were determined by elution peak area integration. The kinetic rate constants for 3D domain swapping dimerization (k a ) were obtained by the nonlinear fitting of the concentrations of domain-swapped dimer at different time points to a secondorder kinetic equation, as previously described [27].

The analysis by RT-qPCR usually requires a previous extraction step to obtain the purified viral RNA. Unfortunately, RNA extraction constitutes a bottleneck for early detection in many countries since it is expensive, time-consuming and depends on the availability of commercial kits. Here, we describe an extraction-free protocol for SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-qPCR from nasopharyngeal swab clinical samples in saline solution. The method includes a treatment with proteinase K followed by heat inactivation (PK+HID method). We demonstrate that PK+HID improves the RT-qPCR performance in comparison to the heat-inactivation procedure. Moreover, we show that this extraction-free protocol can be combined with a variety of multiplexing RT-qPCR kits. The method combined with a multiplexing detection kit targeting N and ORF1ab viral genes showed a sensitivity of 0.99 and a specificity of 0.99 from the analysis of 106 positive and 106 negative clinical samples. In conclusion, PK+HID is a robust, fast and inexpensive procedure for extraction-free RT-qPCR determinations of SARS-CoV-2. The National Administration of Drugs, Foods and Medical Devices of Argentina has recently authorized the use of this method.

PLoS ONE 16(2): e0247792. https:// lack of a vaccine or specific treatment, early detection, isolation and contact tracing are fundamental strategies for reducing the spread of this disease [1] . RT-qPCR is the gold standard method for SARS-CoV-2 determinations [2]. These assays typically involve collecting the clinical specimen usually with nasopharyngeal swabs, extracting the RNA from the sample and analyzing the presence of the viral RNA through RT-qPCR. Nowadays, the RNA extraction step is considered a bottleneck of SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR determinations [3] . This procedure can be automatized but commercial extraction robots are very expensive and may not be affordable for most clinical labs in low-income countries. In contrast, manual RNA-extraction is a quite cumbersome procedure that includes several washing and centrifuging steps at a Biosafety level 2 laboratory and relatively expensive extraction kits. In Argentina, a trained lab technician processes approximately 24 samples every 1.5 hours. Additionally, the skyrocketing increment on the clinical use of RT-qPCR due to the COVID-19 pandemic led to a worldwide shortage of RNA purification reagents [4,5] thus, many research groups around the world have concentrated their efforts on either simplifying or eliminating the extraction step [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Bj\\u00f6rn Reinius at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden [17] optimized an extraction-free sample preparation protocol that only includes a very simple heat-inactivation step at 95\\u02daC during 5 min (HID method). Through HID RT-qPCR, they were able to detect with high sensitivity the relatively short N1 and N2 regions of the viral RNA which are preserved after the heating step. This group also performed an exhaustive analysis of media formulation compatible with the HID method [17] . More recently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has approved a similar thermal-inactivation protocol (1 min at 95\\u02daC) that can be used with Quantabio UltraPlex 1-Step ToughMix (4X) and is sufficient for viral inactivation [18] . This protocol also detects N1 and N2 sequences of the viral RNA. Many protocols traditionally used for extraction-free preparation of clinical samples included treatments with proteinase-K (PK), a commonly used protease that degrade RNases and hence, it helps to preserve RNA integrity [19, 20] . A recent work suggested that PK may facilitate extraction-free determinations of SARS-CoV-2 although a major loss in sensitivity with a~6-units shift in CT values on the determination of the envelope (E) gene [21] may prevent its uses in clinical analysis. Other recent preprint [22] tested a protocol based on PK and heat inactivation using a reduced number of samples (N = 17) in UTM medium with relative low CT values, and claim a good sensitivity on the determination of the E gene. Although these results might seem contradictory with recent findings showing suboptimal detection of the E amplicon on HID samples in UTM medium [17] , the efficiency of the PCR is very dependent on the detection kit, transport medium brand, thermocycler, etc. Here, we combined these strategies and optimized the PK+HID method, a very simple protocol for extraction-free RT-qPCR determinations of SARS-CoV-2. Our results position PK +HID as an inexpensive, versatile and reliable alternative to bypass the traditional RNA extraction procedure and suggest that it could substantially contribute to improve the testing capacity in countries with limited resources and facilities.

The analysis by RT-qPCR usually requires a previous extraction step to obtain the purified viral RNA. Unfortunately, RNA extraction constitutes a bottleneck for early detection in many countries since it is expensive, time-consuming and depends on the availability of commercial kits. Here, we describe an extraction-free protocol for SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-qPCR from nasopharyngeal swab clinical samples in saline solution. The method includes a treatment with proteinase K followed by heat inactivation (PK+HID method). We demonstrate that PK+HID improves the RT-qPCR performance in comparison to the heat-inactivation procedure. Moreover, we show that this extraction-free protocol can be combined with a variety of multiplexing RT-qPCR kits. The method combined with a multiplexing detection kit targeting N and ORF1ab viral genes showed a sensitivity of 0.99 and a specificity of 0.99 from the analysis of 106 positive and 106 negative clinical samples. In conclusion, PK+HID is a robust, fast and inexpensive procedure for extraction-free RT-qPCR determinations of SARS-CoV-2. The National Administration of Drugs, Foods and Medical Devices of Argentina has recently authorized the use of this method.

PLoS ONE 16(2): e0247792. https:// lack of a vaccine or specific treatment, early detection, isolation and contact tracing are fundamental strategies for reducing the spread of this disease [1] . RT-qPCR is the gold standard method for SARS-CoV-2 determinations [2]. These assays typically involve collecting the clinical specimen usually with nasopharyngeal swabs, extracting the RNA from the sample and analyzing the presence of the viral RNA through RT-qPCR. Nowadays, the RNA extraction step is considered a bottleneck of SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR determinations [3] . This procedure can be automatized but commercial extraction robots are very expensive and may not be affordable for most clinical labs in low-income countries. In contrast, manual RNA-extraction is a quite cumbersome procedure that includes several washing and centrifuging steps at a Biosafety level 2 laboratory and relatively expensive extraction kits. In Argentina, a trained lab technician processes approximately 24 samples every 1.5 hours. Additionally, the skyrocketing increment on the clinical use of RT-qPCR due to the COVID-19 pandemic led to a worldwide shortage of RNA purification reagents [4,5] thus, many research groups around the world have concentrated their efforts on either simplifying or eliminating the extraction step [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Bj\\u00f6rn Reinius at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden [17] optimized an extraction-free sample preparation protocol that only includes a very simple heat-inactivation step at 95\\u02daC during 5 min (HID method). Through HID RT-qPCR, they were able to detect with high sensitivity the relatively short N1 and N2 regions of the viral RNA which are preserved after the heating step. This group also performed an exhaustive analysis of media formulation compatible with the HID method [17] . More recently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has approved a similar thermal-inactivation protocol (1 min at 95\\u02daC) that can be used with Quantabio UltraPlex 1-Step ToughMix (4X) and is sufficient for viral inactivation [18] . This protocol also detects N1 and N2 sequences of the viral RNA. Many protocols traditionally used for extraction-free preparation of clinical samples included treatments with proteinase-K (PK), a commonly used protease that degrade RNases and hence, it helps to preserve RNA integrity [19, 20] . A recent work suggested that PK may facilitate extraction-free determinations of SARS-CoV-2 although a major loss in sensitivity with a~6-units shift in CT values on the determination of the envelope (E) gene [21] may prevent its uses in clinical analysis. Other recent preprint [22] tested a protocol based on PK and heat inactivation using a reduced number of samples (N = 17) in UTM medium with relative low CT values, and claim a good sensitivity on the determination of the E gene. Although these results might seem contradictory with recent findings showing suboptimal detection of the E amplicon on HID samples in UTM medium [17] , the efficiency of the PCR is very dependent on the detection kit, transport medium brand, thermocycler, etc. Here, we combined these strategies and optimized the PK+HID method, a very simple protocol for extraction-free RT-qPCR determinations of SARS-CoV-2. Our results position PK +HID as an inexpensive, versatile and reliable alternative to bypass the traditional RNA extraction procedure and suggest that it could substantially contribute to improve the testing capacity in countries with limited resources and facilities.

Additionally, the modification of Bbox-like element in the 5 UTR region strongly debilitated crossovers. Along the lines of these observations, RNA3 mutants not expressing CP or expressing mutated CPs also reduced recombination. A series of reciprocal transfections demonstrated a functional crosstalk between the Bbox and PE elements.

Like the rH120-infected group and in contrast to the rIBYZ-infected group, no mortality, clinical signs, or lesions were observed in the lungs or kidneys of young chickens inoculated with rH120-S1/YZ. The viral loads in various tissues, cloacal, and oral swabs was lower in most types of samples, indicating that the rH120-S1/YZ strain was highly safe in chicks. Compared to rH120 vaccination group, when the efficacy of this strain was evaluated against the QXlike IBV strain, better protection, with 100% survival rate and no disease symptom or gross lesion was observed in the chickens vaccinated with rH120-S1/YZ. Increased levels of IBV-specific antibodies were detected in the serum of the rH120-S1/YZ-vaccinated animals 14 days post-vaccination. Collectively, our results suggest that the recombinant strain, rH120-S1/YZ, may represent a promising vaccine candidate against QX-like IBVs. \"],\n [\"The latitude hypothesis, vitamin D, and SARS-Co-V2\",\n\"The Latitude Hypothesis may explain seasonal variation in occurrence of flu and influenza-like illness, including SARS-CoV-2.

Benchmarking based on the increase in total cases or case fatality rates is one way of comparing the evolution of the pandemic across countries or territories and could inform policy decisions about strategies to control coronavirus transmission. However, comparing cases and fatality rates across regions is challenging due to heterogeneity in testing and health systems. We show two complementary ways of benchmarking across territories and in time. First, we used multivariate regressions to estimate the test-elasticity of Covid-19 case incidence. Cases grow less than proportionally with testing when assessing weekly changes or looking across states in the USA. They tend to be proportional or even more than proportional when comparing the month-tomonth evolution of an average country in the pandemic. Our results were robust to various model specifications. Second, we decomposed the growth in cases into test growth and positive test ratio growth to intuitively visualize the components of case growth. We hope these results can help support evidence-based decisions by public officials and help the public discussion when comparing across territories and in time.

However, data comparing performance of salivary tests against commercially-available serologic and neutralizing antibody (nAb) assays are lacking. This study compared the performance of a multiplex salivary SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay targeting antibodies to nucleocapsid (N), receptor binding domain (RBD) and spike (S) antigens to three commercially-available SARS-CoV-2 serology enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) (Ortho Vitros, Euroimmun, and BioRad) and nAb. Paired saliva and plasma samples were collected from 101 eligible COVID-19 convalescent plasma (CCP) donors >14 days since PCR+ confirmed diagnosis. Concordance was evaluated using positive (PPA) and negative (NPA) percent agreement, overall percent agreement (PA), and Cohen's kappa coefficient. The range between salivary and plasma EIAs for SARS-CoV-2-specific N was PPA: 54.4-92.1% and NPA: 69.2-91.7%, for RBD was PPA: 89.9-100% and NPA: 50.0-84.6%, and for S was PPA: 50.6-96.6% and NPA: 50.0-100%. Compared to a plasma nAb assay, the multiplex salivary assay PPA ranged from 62.3% (N) and 98.6% (RBD) and NPA ranged from 18.8% (RBD) to 96.9% (S).

This study aimed to monitor coronaviruses (CoVs) and paramyxoviruses (PMVs) in bats roosting in northwest Italian regions. Our investigation was focused on CoVs and PMVs due to their proven ability to switch host and their zoonotic potential. Here we provide the phylogenetic characterization of the highly conserved polymerase gene fragments. Results: Family-wide PCR screenings were used to test 302 bats belonging to 19 different bat species. Thirty-eight animals from 12 locations were confirmed as PCR positive, with an overall detection rate of 12.6% [95% CI: 9.3-16.8]. CoV RNA was found in 36 bats belonging to eight species, while PMV RNA in three Pipistrellus spp. Phylogenetic characterization have been obtained for 15 alpha-CoVs, 5 beta-CoVs and three PMVs; moreover one P. pipistrellus resulted co-infected with both CoV and PMV. A divergent alpha-CoV clade from Myotis nattereri SpA is also described. The compact cluster of beta-CoVs from R. ferrumequinum roosts expands the current viral sequence database, specifically for this species in Europe. To our knowledge this is the first report of CoVs in Plecotus auritus and M. oxygnathus, and of PMVs in P. kuhlii. Conclusions: This study identified alpha and beta-CoVs in new bat species and in previously unsurveyed Italian regions. To our knowledge this represents the first and unique report of PMVs in Italy. The 23 new bat genetic sequences presented will expand the current molecular bat-borne virus databases. Considering the amount of novel bat-borne PMVs associated with the emergence of zoonotic infections in animals and humans in the last years, the definition of viral diversity within European bat species is needed. Performing surveillance studies within a specific geographic area can provide awareness of viral burden where bats roost in close proximity to spillover hosts, and form the basis for the appropriate control measures against potential threats for public health and optimal management of bats and their habitats. \",\n\"Coronavirus and paramyxovirus in bats from Northwest Italy[SEP]Background: Bat-borne virus surveillance is necessary for determining inter-species transmission risks and is important due to the wide-range of bat species which may harbour potential pathogens.

One of the key proteins in long-term synaptic plasticity and memory is the activity-regulated cytoskeleton-associated protein (Arc). Mammalian Arc forms virus-like capsid structures in a process requiring the N-terminal domain and contains two C-terminal lobes that are structural homologues to retroviral capsids. Drosophila has two isoforms of Arc, dArc1 and dArc2, with low sequence similarity to mammalian Arc, but lacking a large N-terminal domain. Both dArc isoforms are related to the Ty3/gypsy retrotransposon capsid, consisting of N-and C-terminal lobes. Structures of dArc1, as well as capsids formed by both dArc isoforms, have been recently determined. We carried out structural characterization of the four individual dArc lobe domains. As opposed to the corresponding mammalian Arc lobe domains, which are monomeric, the dArc lobes were all oligomeric in solution, indicating a strong propensity for homophilic interactions. A truncated N-lobe from dArc2 formed a domain-swapped dimer in the crystal structure, resulting in a novel dimer interaction that could be relevant for capsid assembly or other dArc functions. This domain-swapped structure resembles the dimeric protein C of flavivirus capsids, as well as the structure of histones dimers, domain-swapped transcription factors, and membrane-interacting BAK domains. The strong oligomerization properties of the isolated dArc lobe domains explain the ability of dArc to form capsids in the absence of any large N-terminal domain, in contrast to the mammalian protein.

PLoS ONE 16(5): e0251459. https://doi.org/ 10. regulate gene expression [4, 9, 10] . The targeting of AMPA receptors may involve direct interactions of stargazin (TARP\\u03b32) with both AMPA receptors and Arc [11] [12] [13] . Due to its many interaction partners, Arc regulates several neuronal signalling processes as well as the structure of the postsynaptic density scaffold [2, 14] . Arc forms capsid-like structures that may transfer information from one neuron to another [15, 16] . Mammalian Arc (mArc) has a C-terminal domain (Arc-CT) with close structural homology to the C-terminal domain (CA-CTD) of the retroviral capsid (CA) protein [12] , and mArc-CT consists of two structurally similar lobe domains, N-lobe (NL) and C-lobe (CL) [12, 17] . Viral CA has in addition an N-terminal domain (CA-NTD), and both CA-NTD and CA-CTD are involved in viral capsid assembly. mArc has a large N-terminal domain (Arc-NT) of unknown structure, which is absent in dArc. The Arc-NT is predicted to have homology to the retroviral matrix domain and is required for the formation of large mArc oligomers. Without its N-terminal domain, mArc is monomeric in solution [18] . In mArc, it is likely that the presence of both mArc-NT and mArc-CT are required for high-order oligomerization and capsid formation [19, 20]. Drosophila has two Arc isoforms (dArc1 and dArc2), which share high sequence similarity. Drosophila Arc (dArc) isoforms have a CT domain, containing tandem N-and C-lobes, but lack an Arc-NT found in mArc. However, dArc forms capsids [16] , whose structure has been determined by electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM) [21]. In addition, the crystal structure of dimeric dArc1, containing both N-and C-lobes, was recently determined [22]. Whether dArc functions similarly to mArc in neurons, even if the functionally important mArc-NT is missing and the sequence similarity to mArc is low, is currently unknown. Mammalian Arc also forms capsid-like structures [16] , but the high-resolution structure remains to be solved. We set out to determine structures of the individual dArc lobe domains. The CL of both dArc1 and dArc2 is structurally homologous to the mArc-CL, confirming the connection of dArc to both mArc and retroviral capsids. The structure of dArc2-NL showed a domainswapped dimer, resulting in a structure similar to the flavivirus capsid protein and resembling histones as well as membrane-interacting BAK domains. All individual dArc lobes were oligomeric in solution, in contrast to the monomeric mArc-CT. Such oligomeric units, reflective of the different evolutionary pathways leading to mammalian and insect Arc, could be building blocks during the assembly of virus-like capsids by full-length dArc, or they could relate to other functions of dArc.

The cells were lysed in HBS (40 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl) containing 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme, by one freeze-thaw cycle followed by sonication. The lysate was centrifuged at 16 000 g for 30 min at +4\\u02daC and loaded onto a Ni-NTA resin. After washing with HBS containing 20 mM imidazole, the protein was eluted with HBS containing 300 mM imidazole. His-tagged TEV protease [23] was added to the eluate, and the sample was dialyzed against 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, and 1 mM dithiothreitol for 20 h at +4\\u02daC.

Between 2014 and 2019, our MICU successfully proned seventy-nine patients, with increasing experience over time. New York City was an epicenter of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. In the face of this pandemic, our hospital increased our ICU capacity by over 250% in the setting of a surge of critically ill COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory failure. ICUs were created throughout the hospital in non-traditional areas including operating rooms, medical-surgical floors, post-procedural observation units and in the emergency department. Additionally, other subspecialty ICUs, including neurologic, pediatric, post-surgical and cardiac were repurposed to treat primarily adult patients with COVID-19-associated acute respiratory failure and ARDS requiring mechanical ventilation. Many of these patients met criteria for moderate-to-severe ARDS, but ICU staff outside of the MICU were not familiar with prone positioning. In an effort to increase our ability to meet this demand, we rapidly developed and trained a mobile prone team, capable of servicing ICUs throughout the hospital.

Data Collection and Analysis Baseline characteristics and clinical measures, including sex, age, height, weight, date of endotracheal intubation, date of prone position initiation, mechanical ventilator settings and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score at time of prone position initiation were retrospectively collected for all patients treated by the COVID-19 Prone Team from April 2 through April 30, 2020. Further clinical measures and patient outcomes, including number of daily positionings completed, duration of proning, PaO 2 :FiO 2 during proning, adverse events during proning, patient tolerance of prone positioning, days on mechanical ventilation, tracheostomy, and mortality were collected through May 14, 2020. Continuous variables were expressed as means (+/-Standard Deviation) and medians (Interquartile range). Categorical variables were summarized as counts and percentages. This study was approved by Columbia University Irving Medical Center Institutional Review Board (study number AAAT0603). Between April 2 and April 30, 2020, ninety patients were treated by the COVID-19 Prone Team. Of these ninety patients, thirteen required two unique proning episodes at separate time points during their hospitalization due to recurrent moderate-to-severe ARDS that met criteria for J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof \"],\n [\"Human metapneumovirus: a new respiratory pathogen\",\n\"Human metapneumovirus is a recently recognized pathogen of acute respiratory tract infection (ARI) in children as well as elderly and immunocompromised adults. The virus belongs to the family Paramyxoviridae, sub family Pneumovirinae and genus Metapneumovirus. Through genetic analysis it has been characterized into two groups A and B which are further divided into four sub-lineages. The virus is diffi cult to grow in tissue culture and hence reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for N and L gene is the method of choice for diagnosis. The virus has been seen in all countries with seasonal distribution in winter months for temperate and spring/summer for tropical countries. F gene is the most conserved among different lineages and efforts are underway to design recombination vaccine using F gene.

However, sleep deprivation may alter respiratory function and may promote respiratory failure. We hypothesized that sleep alterations after extubation could be associated with an increased risk of post-extubation respiratory failure and reintubation. We conducted a prospective observational cohort study performed at the medical ICU of the university hospital of Poitiers in France. Patients at high-risk of extubation failure (> 65 years, with any underlying cardiac or lung disease, or intubated > 7 days) were included. Patients intubated less than 24 h, with central nervous or psychiatric disorders, continuous sedation, neuroleptic medication, or uncooperative were excluded. Sleep was assessed by complete polysomnography just following extubation including the night. The main objective was to compare sleep between patients who developed post-extubation respiratory failure or required reintubation and the others. Results: Over a 3-year period, 52 patients had complete polysomnography among whom 12 (23%) developed post-extubation respiratory failure and 8 (15%) required reintubation. Among them, 10 (19%) had atypical sleep, 15 (29%) had no deep sleep, and 33 (63%) had no rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Total sleep time was 3.2 h in median [interquartile range, 2.0-4.4] in patients who developed post-extubation respiratory failure vs. 2.0 [1.1-3.8] in those who were successfully extubated (p = 0.34). Total sleep time, and durations of deep and REM sleep stages did not differ between patients who required reintubation and the others. Reintubation rates were 21% (7/33) in patients with no REM sleep and 5% (1/19) in patients with REM sleep (difference, \\u2212 16% [95% CI \\u2212 33% to 6%]; p = 0.23).

Hypoxia-induced inflammatory signaling may lead to retinal inflammation, gliosis and visual disturbances. We investigated the consequences of systemic hypoxia using serial retinal optical coherence tomography and by assessing the earliest changes within 24h after hypoxia by measuring a proteomics panel of 39 cytokines, chemokines and growth factors in the plasma and retina, as well as using retinal histology. We induced severe systemic hypoxia in adult C57BL/6 mice using a hypoxia chamber (10% O 2 ) for 1 week and rapidly assessed measurements within 1h compared with 18h after hypoxia. Optical coherence tomography revealed retinal tissue edema at 18h after hypoxia. Hierarchical clustering of plasma and retinal immune molecules revealed obvious segregation of the 1h posthypoxia group away from that of controls. One hour after hypoxia, there were 10 significantly increased molecules in plasma and 4 in retina. Interleukin-1\\u03b2 and vascular endothelial growth factor were increased in both tissues. Concomitantly, there was significantly increased aquaporin-4, decreased Kir4.1, and increased gliosis in retinal histology. In summary, the immediate posthypoxic period is characterized by molecular changes consistent with systemic and retinal inflammation and retinal glial changes important in water transport, leading to tissue edema. This posthypoxic inflammation rapidly improves within 24h, consistent with the typically mild and transient visual disturbance in hypoxia, such as in high-altitude retinopathy. Given hypoxia increases risk of vision loss, more studies in at-risk patients, such as plasma immune profiling and in vivo retinal imaging, are needed in order to identify novel diagnostic or prognostic biomarkers of visual impairment in systemic hypoxia.

Although physical distancing measures played a key role in slowing COVID-19 spread in early 2020, infection rates are now peaking at record levels across the country. Hospitals in several states are threatened with overwhelming numbers of patients, compounding the death toll of COVID-19. Implementing strategies to minimize COVID-19 hospitalizations will be key to controlling the toll of the disease, but non-physical distancing strategies receive relatively little attention. We present a novel system of differential equations designed to predict the relative effects of hospitalizing fewer COVID-19 patients vs increasing ICU bed availability on delaying ICU bed shortages. This model, which we call SEAHIRD, was calibrated to mortality data on two US states with different peak infection times from mid-March -mid-May 2020. It found that hospitalizing fewer COVID-19 patients generally delays ICU bed shortage more than a comparable increase in ICU bed availability. This trend was consistent across both states and across wide ranges of initial conditions and parameter values.

Belonging to a glucocorticoid family, Dexamethasone (Dex) is a powerful anti-inflammatory compound that is widely used as therapy in autoimmune disease conditions or allogeneic transplantation. However, minimal immunomodulatory effect of hMSCs may limit their therapeutic uses. Moreover, the effect of glucocorticoids on the immunomodulatory molecules or other regenerative properties of tissue-specific hMSCs remains unknown. Method: Herein, we evaluated the in vitro effect of Dex at various dose concentrations and time intervals, 1000 ng/ ml, 2000 ng/ml, 3000 ng/ml and 24 h, 48 h respectively, on the basic characteristics and immunomodulatory properties of Bone marrow derived MSC (BM-MSCs), Adipose tissue derived MSCs (AD-MSCs), Dental Pulp derived MSC (DP-MSCs) and Umbilical cord derived MSCs (UC-MSCs). The present study indicated that the concentration of Dex did not ramify the cellular morphology nor showed cytotoxicity as well as conserved the basic characteristics of tissue specific hMSCs including cell proliferation and surface marker profiling. However, quite interestingly it was observed that the stemness markers (Oct-4, Sox-2, Nanog and Klf-4) showed a significant upregulation in DP-MSCs and AD-MSCs followed by UC-MSCs and BM-MSCs. Additionally, immunomodulatory molecules, Prostaglandin E-2 (PGE-2), Indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and Human Leukocyte Antigen-G (HLA-G) were seen to be upregulated in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, there was a differential response of tissue specific hMSCs after pre-conditioning with Dex during mixed lymphocyte reaction, wherein UC-MSCs and DP-MSCs showed enhanced immunosuppression as compared to AD-MSCs and BM-MSCs, thereby proving to be a better candidate for therapeutic applications in immune-related diseases. Conclusion: Dex preconditioning improved the hMSCs immunomodulatory property and may have reduced the challenge associated with minimal potency and strengthen their therapeutic efficacy. \",\n\"Dexamethasone priming enhances stemness and immunomodulatory property of tissue-specific human mesenchymal stem cells Open Access[SEP]Background: Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells (hMSCs) represent a promising cell source for cell-based therapy in autoimmune diseases and other degenerative disorders due to their immunosuppressive, anti-inflammatory and regenerative potentials.
