This project tackles these challenges with a focus on visual object recognition in human and nonhuman primates. Object recognition is a still poorly understood key problem of computational neuroscience with implications for cortical computation in general. We will test computational models and relate representational content of population codes between human and nonhuman primates by means of a novel multivariate technique called representational similarity analysis (RSA). The core idea of RSA is to characterize a given brain representation by a dissimilarity matrix of stimulus-evoked activity patterns and to visualize and statistically compare such dissimilarity matrices. In contrast to existing approaches, computational models here form an integral component of the analysis of brain-activity data. We will match up representationally homologous regions between human and nonhuman primate and determine which computational models best explain the empirical data (from human and nonhuman primate fMRI) for each brain region. Moreover this project will further develop the technique of RSA and provide an easy-to-use and freely available Matlab toolbox to the community. By richly relating brain theory to data and human to nonhuman primate studies, this project bridges major divides and will contribute to a more integrated systems neuroscience.\"],\n [\"EU100001\",\n\"New Opportunities for Research Funding Agency Co-operation in Europe II\",\n\"NORFACE is a co-ordinated common action of fifteen national research funding agencies. NORFACE stands for New Opportunities for Research Funding Agency Co-operation in Europe. The ERA-NET NORFACE Co-ordination Action started in January 2004 and has developed a close partnership and network of European national agencies responsible for funding research in the social sciences. The NORFACE Co-ordination Action formally ended in September 2009. The NORFACE-SA Partners together provide the capacity for significant levels of co-operation and exchange. They are committed to an ambitious programme of communication, enquiry, sharing of experience and action.The central Work package of the current proposal, Work package 1, is on Joint Research and Related Activities and Initiatives. This will involve the scoping and identifying of the multidisciplinary research needs with a view to developing joint research and related initiatives.Work package 2, Exploiting Data  Infrastructure in the Social Sciences, forms an important part of the proposal. In many European countries initiatives are taken to improve the infrastructure for research in the social sciences. By discussing national and international strategic initiatives, developing mechanisms to exploit data, and by co-ordinating a joint approach, NORFACE can have a contribution to the development of a European data infrastructure for the social sciences.The proposed ERA-NET NORFACE-II Support Action aims at further deepening and strengthening the established trans-national co-operation based on the experience gained and the existing co-operation structures, but also broadening the network activities and the EU impact, in order to successfully prepare a new ERA-NET Co-ordination Action and/or ERA-NET Plus.\"],\n [\"EU100002\",\n\"USA and Europe Cooperation in Mini UAVs\",\n\"Unmanned Aerial Systems have been an active area of research in recent years all around the world. Top research centres in the word are working on new applications, improving previous ones, solving specific problems in the different areas. Each centre has taken a special area of the whole field into focus and they are taking specialization on it. It makes a huge scattered network of knowledge.The project that we present here is an attempt to connect some relevant nodes of this network putting in contact 4 leading research centres whit experience in different fields connected and complementary, but not superposed. Thus, the opportunities and strength of each partner will be increased.The members of the consortium are:\\u2022 The ASU (Arizona State University)  Robotics Laboratory (http://robotics.asu.edu ) has significant experience in designing, building and deploying aerial and aquatic mobile robot systems. The present inventory of robots includes multiple fixed wing, rotary aerial vehicles and autonomous underwater vehicles with varied capabilities in sensing and actuation.\\u2022 The Link\\u00f6ping University, Artificial Intelligence & Integrated Computer Systems Division (http://www.ida.liu.se/~patdo/aiicssite1 ), contributes with his experience in quadrotor systems for indoor and outdoor, visual navigation and with Software Architectures for micro-uavs.\\u2022 The Universidad Polit\\u00e9cnica Madrid, Computer Vision Group (www.disam.upm.es/colibri ), contributes with his experience in visual guidance and visual control for rotatory UAVs.All the above makes a great opportunity to share knowledge, expertise, work-styles, etc. different operative test beds, laboratories and R&D leading technology facilities and no less importance, cultural aspects.\"],\n [\"EU100003\",\n\"Sustainable Infrastructure for Resilient Urban Environments\",\n\"This fellowship aim is to identify how the use of underground space and its physical infrastructure (PI) influence, interact with and impact on sustainability, vulnerability and resilience of urban areas, both now and in the future. Three case study cities (Berlin, London, Saint Petersburg) will serve as a basis for analysis of present and future interaction of Urban Underground Infrastructure (UUI) with the urban environment.Analysis of the present UUI role in the city is based on previous research results of Dr. Bobylev, including environmental assessment of underground structures and comparative analysis of UUI using urban sustainability indicators. The team at the University of Birmingham provides background for analysis of development scenarios (partly as a result of the current involvement in the Urban Futures project).Research methodology will employ Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis and Geographical Information Systems tools. Main work packages include collection of data on UUI (and other PI where needed), presenting this data in the form of quantitative indicators (e.g. volume, energy loss in network); analysis of UUI against sustainability and land use indicators; modeling indicator performance in future scenarios, developing policy recommendations for UUI planning and adaptation. It is important that feedback (in the form of expert interviews) of the case study cities relevant authorities will be integrated into policy recommendations developed during the fellowship.Dr. Bobylev is a pioneering researcher in the area of PI sustainability quantitative analysis and this fellowship will allow him to develop this idea further in a team of world leading experts on UUI.'\"],\n [\"EU100004\",\n\"Modelling star formation in the local universe\",\n\"The goal of this proposal is to revolutionize our understanding of star formation in nearby galaxies, using numerical simulations. Traditionally, research in star formation has considered the contraction of a giant molecular cloud (GMC), or more commonly a star forming core, under gravity. However there has been relatively little research on molecular clouds themselves, even though they provide the initial conditions for star formation, and thus determine the main assumptions for theories of star formation. The proposed research will focus on the scales of giant molecular clouds, the clouds of molecular hydrogen (H2) where most star formation takes place in nearby galaxies. These objects link galactic scale physics with the small scale physics of star formation. Only now are the computational resources becoming available to study the interstellar medium (ISM) numerically on galactic scales, and model the complex processes involved in GMC and star formation. Simultaneously observational programs (e.g. ALMA, Herschel, CARMA) are starting to resolve GMCs in nearby galaxies. Our research will involve performing calculations on scales from individual GMCs to interacting galaxies, and comparing to forthcoming observations to answer some of the most fundamental questions in star formation, such as why star formation is inefficient, how do GMCs form and what are their lifetimes.\"],\n [\"EU100005\",\n\"Coherent spin manipulation in hybrid nanostructures\",\n\"The rapid development of novel nanoelectronic devices utilizing the spin degree of freedom of the charge carriers and thus reaching beyond the limitations of traditional semiconductor based technologies is one of the central issues in nowadays spintronics. A special emphasis is put on the fabrication and investigation of hybrid nanostructures exploiting the complementary benefits of metallic, semiconducting, magnetic as well as the recently explored, low dimensional carbon based systems (carbon nanotubes, graphen).The proposed project aims to design various hybrid nanostructures defined by optical and electron beam lithography and to develop novel schemes for determining spin-related material parameters (g-factor, spin diffusion length, spin-injection efficiency and spin transfer torque) via transport measurements. This is essential in order to explore electron spin dynamics, decoherence and relaxation for multifunctional applications (fast switching elements, combined logical and storage devices, quantum dot based semiconductor spin qbits) and to determine conditions for coherent spin-transfer in nano/micro-circuits as well as methods of detection of spin currents. These experiments help to understand and control the coherent spin states of individual charge carriers, which is fundamental for the field of quantum computation in a solid state environment.The host institute possesses all the necessary nanofabrication facilities and the high-end cryogenic background for the successful implementation of device fabrication and low-level magnetotransport measurements. The host has also pioneered the measurement technique for determining spin-polarization and spin transfer torque in nanoscale magnetic systems with a resolution down to the scale of atomic junctions.\"],\n [\"EU100006\",\n\"Stochastic Modeling of Spatially Extended Ecosystems and Ecological and Climate Data Analysis\",\n\"The coupling between ecosystems and the climate implies that quantifying their dynamics is crucial for our attempts to prevent undesired changes in our environment. The main goal of this project is to use non-linear, stochastic modeling in the context of climate and ecosystems dynamics. This proposal combines methods from statistical physics, non-linear dynamics, game theory and random dynamical systems to study the various effects of noise on climate and ecosystems dynamics. The specific goals of this project are:(i) Using the record of past climate observations to build dynamically-weighted forecasting ensembles adjusted to specific climate variables. These ensembles will enable inter-comparison of the models. Using the sequential compound decision method will reduce the uncertainties of climate predictions. (ii) Investigating the dynamics of non-linear vegetation models, in the homoclinic snaking regime, in the presence of global and local noise. Early-warning signals and the possibility of desertification not through critical transition but through a series of transitions between localized states will be studied. (iii) Analyzing data describing the process of vegetation mortality under controlled and natural drought conditions. Spatial and temporal patterns in the mortality process will be studied and related to quantitative models. Theoretical models will be developed and tested against the data. The expected results of this research will not only improve our understanding of climate and ecosystems dynamics but will also advance fundamental physics research such as the interplay between complex non-linear dynamics and stochastic effects.\"],\n [\"EU100007\",\n\"Secure Multiparty Computation in the von Neumann Architecture\",\n\"The ultimate aim of this project is to design and implement an efficient virtual machine that can be used in practice for generic secure multiparty computation (MPC).MPC is a way to convert any distributed computation that can be performed securely with the assistance of a trusted third party into a protocol that does not require any third parties, yet gives the same output and remains just as secure.The existence of MPC is one of the breakthrough results of modern cryptography. These results appear to be extremely relevant for problems in many areas - wherever there is tension between privacy, trust and functionality. In practice, however, there is very little real-world use of these techniques.Existing MPC techniques involve translating a function to be computed into a logical circuit. This architecture has some drawbacks, however, that we believe contribute to the scarcity of real-world use of these techniques. In particular, programs whose running time is potentially very long are infeasible to implement as circuits (since a circuit's size depends on the maximal running time of a program). Moreover, there are far more engineers familiar with programming than with the constraints of circuit design.In this project we propose to take a new approach to practical MPC: changing it from a ``hardware engineering' problem (designing circuits) to one of ``software engineering' (writing programs). The high-level idea is to develop a ``secure computation virtual machine' in the von Neumann architecture: a virtual CPU and virtual RAM that can run programs in a similar way to a modern physical computer system. Such an architecture would allow secure programs to be compiled directly from standard programming languages (such as C or Java). The hope is that, once such a system exists, MPC will become accessible to the many software engineers who already know how to program but do not have time to learn new, MPC-specific languages or circuit design.\"],\n [\"EU100008\",\n\"Infrastructures for Community-Based Data Management\",\n\"Structured data is increasingly created, transmitted, and archived across the Web. One of the most important movements in this context, the Linked Data movement, promulgates the rapid online publication of large-scale structured data following three basic principles: i) the creation of a Unique Resource Identifier (URI) for each resource published, ii) the publication of structured data at the URI corresponding to the the resource, and iii) the inclusion of links relating each resource to similar online resources.Publication of Linked Data in various formalisms is currently booming on the Web, fostered by important governmental agencies, social networks, and scientists from various domains. Unrelated communities of users are increasingly interested in querying, manipulating, and arbitrary combining Linked Data in the large to create new applications. Unfortunately, the current data infrastructures at their disposal only provide very limited and rather inefficient support to their needs.The present proposal focuses on designing new distributed data management infrastructures to promote distributed, community-based manipulations of such heterogenous and interlinked data in the large. Two related research problems are tackled. The first problem revolves around the design and implementation of an efficient storage platform to  represent, query, and distribute very large amounts of Linked Data. The second problem focuses on new abstraction mechanisms to integrate Linked Data sets a posteriori once they have already been  published. The rest of this document defines the main research challenges to be tackled in this context, and outlines a research agenda to realize this vision. It follows the structure suggested in the Work Programme to describe a Career Reintegration Grant proposal.\"],\n [\"EU100009\",\n\"Reducing Environmental Footprint based on Multi-Modal Fleet management System for Eco-Routing and Driver Behaviour Adaptation\",\n\"Reduction of CO2 emissions is the great challenge of the transport sector nowadays. Despite progress in vehicle manufacturing and fuel technology, additional innovative technologies are needed to address this challenge. According to the Int. Assoc. of Public Transport, a significant fraction of CO2 emissions in EU cities is resulting from public transport and other mass transport means, which are commonly organized into multi-modal transport fleets, because their vehicles have, on average, nearly substantial mileage and fuel consumption.<br/>The REDUCTION project focuses on advanced ICT solutions for managing multi-modal fleets and reducing their environmental footprint. REDUCTION collects historic and real-time data about driving behaviour, routing information, and emissions measurements, that are processed by advanced predictive analytics to enable fleets enhancing their current services as follows: 1) Optimizing driving behaviour: supporting effective decision making for the enhancement of drivers' education and the formation of effective policies about optimal traffic operations (speeding, braking, etc.), based on the analytical results over the data that associate driving-behaviour patterns with CO2 emissions. 2) Eco-routing: suggesting environmental-friendly routes and allowing multi-modal fleets to reduce their overall mileage automatically. 3) Support for multi-modality: offering a transparent way to support multiple transportation modes and enabling co-modality.<br/>REDUCTION follows an interdisciplinary approach and brings together expertise from several communities. Its innovative, decentralized architecture allows scalability to large fleets by combining both V2V and V2I approaches. Its planned commercial exploitation, based on its proposed cutting-edge technology, aims at providing a major breakthrough in the fast growing market of services for 'green' fleets in EU and worldwide, and present substantial impact to the challenging environmental goals of EU.\"],\n [\"EU100010\",\n\"Action to Support Photonic Innovation Clusters in Europe\",\n\"The enabling technology of photonics has grown dramatically worldwide over the last 20 years and has now become a key emerging technology in a modern industrial economy. Europe has benefited disproportionately from this growth having increased its photonic revenues by 30% in the period 2005 \\u2013 2008. In parallel with this expansion, photonic clusters have emerged so that today we have in excess of 40 photonic innovation clusters across Europe. Many of these clusters have initially focused correctly on their indigenous growth but to achieve long term growth there must be a greater focus on cluster collaboration in Europe, particularly across value/supply chains where photonics is a key driver.<br/>The need for on-going international cooperation among photonics clusters is pivotal in increasing their overall effectiveness in promoting research and innovation, strengthening the European economy and addressing societal challenges. ASPICE aspires to advance this cause by:\\u0095\\\\tsurveying the photonic innovation clusters and platforms landscape and developing a reference guide of good practices. Under the term good practices, the reference guide will refer to specific, proven, efficient (least amount of effort) and effective (best results) services provided by clusters and platforms.\\u0095\\\\tprofiling and leveraging the value/supply chains in two societal challenges where photonics technology will be a key solution provider, namely 'Healthcare in an Aging Society' and 'Safety and security for Europe's citizens'.\\u0095\\\\tengaging cluster and platform representatives and other relevant stakeholders to ensure the 'translation' of the reference guide and the value/supply chain profiles into actionable plans for embedding the more suitable practices into the programmes of Europe's photonic clusters.<br/>Outcomes will be delivered through a set of public reference guides, a value/supply chain matchmaking service and a series of cluster co-ordination workshops.\"],\n [\"EU100011\",\n\"Improving therapy and intervention through imaging\",\n\"The scientific objective of the programme is to design, develop, and validate new imaging technologies to improve the performance and safety of therapeutic and interventional procedures.  Improving therapy and surgery planning will be approached using multimodal imaging strategies, lesion and dysfunctional tissue characterization, efficient segmentation and image fusion techniques. Image guided therapy and intervention improvements will be pursued by designing the integration of new imaging modalities in the surgical workflow, providing new techniques to compensate for undesired motions as well as innovative methods and instruments to integrate new intraoperative imaging devices. Follow-up and therapy outcome is a major concern and will be approached using innovative methodologies to quantitatively assess and predict recovery and prognosis after therapy or surgery. Furthermore, concrete scenarios will be considered within the frameworks of interventional cardiac therapy and surgery and soft tissue organs therapy. New workflows will be proposed incorporating the new technologies in these concrete scenarios.The objectives to add value to the ERA will be:\\u2022 To develop new techniques and methodologies to assist in the development of new therapy surgical procedures. This will clearly improve the position of the European partners towards technology transfer to the healthcare technology industry.\\u2022 To improve the healthcare of European citizens by providing new and safer means of therapy and surgery.\\u2022 To increase the skills and knowledge of the EU partners in order to better perform clinical translational research implying new technologies.This project is a multidisciplinary initiative allowing the exchange of scientists among four research institutes with international recognition in medical imaging and biomedical engineering.\"],\n [\"EU100012\",\n\"Design and manufacturing of smart composite panelsfor wing applications and development of structuralhealth monitoring techniques\",\n\"The goals of the call will be achieved by means of a \\u201cmultilevel\\u201d approach, combining local damage propagation mechanisms with guided waves propagation modeling, and designing a dedicated optimization methodology aimed at finding the best actuators/sensors positioning in order to enhance the tool sensitivity to forecasted impact damages.The final results will be a numerical tool (or a family of tools) developed in high level programming language and capable of driving commercial codes (F.E. codes like MSC/NASTRAN ad LS-DYNA) within an optimization strategy. The consortium is made by two SMEs and the Department of Structural and Transportation Engineering of the University of Padova; the partners include all the needed expertise in the fields of numerical simulation (explicit and implicit F.E.) described above, as well as in the field of Structural Health Monitoring approaches based on guided waves and optimization tools. The production of GFR Panels will be supplied by external subcontracting to a primary supplier of composite structural components for aeronautical use.Within the NDE techniques special attention will be dedicated to the \\u2018virtual implementation\\u2019 of a novel damage detection method based on the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition.\"],\n [\"EU100013\",\n\"Numerical and EXperimental shock conTrol on laminar Wing\",\n\"The utilization of laminar flow technology is one necessary mean to further improve the eco-efficiency of future transport aircraft. Because of the different pressure distribution type and the reduced sweep of laminar wings the drag rise is encountered at lower Mach numbers and is steeper than with conventional turbulent wings. The availability of effective shock control technologies is therefore highly desired in connection with future laminar aircraft. Previous research demonstrated that shock control bumps (SCB) are a promising means to reduce the wave drag at a certain design condition at least for turbulent wings. However, SCB shapes considered so far show significant performance degradation at Mach and cl below their design condition. The NextWing project aimes on the development of effective and robust 3D shock control bumps (SCB). Novel aspects are the specific derivation of appropriate basic shapes for laminar wing pressure distributions, the reduction of negative sweep effects by dedicated shaping of the side flanks and the significant improvement of the robustness against variations of the freestream conditions. The objective is to improve the overall performance of laminar wings for typical flight mission scenarios and to significantly reduce the wave drag at high Mach. This goal shall be achieved by systematic joint numerical and experimental studies on SCB flow physics and the impact of relevant SCB properties on performance at design and off-design conditions. The project will benefit from extensive experience of the partners in shock control and SCB design and from the availability of dedicated numerical and experimental tools developed during more than 10 years of SCB research. The outcome of the project will result in detailed design guidelines that enable the efficient design of robust 3D SCBs for arbitrary laminar aircraft configurations.\"],\n [\"EU100014\",\n\"NUtrition and microVAScular dynamics in COGnitive health\",\n\"This IRG will support my return to the EU as a Senior Lecturer in Nutrition and Neuroscience at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, bringing state-of-the-art science and technology, collaborations, and excellent prospects for reintegration and the enhancement of European competitiveness. My research aims to elucidate the metabolic basis of brain aging and develop interventions for preventing dementia and brain vascular disease. We address a timely and fundamental question regarding microvascular mechanisms of cognitive decline.  Our central hypothesis is that impairment of brain microvascular plasticity due to age, diet or disease, is a pivotal mechanism of cognitive decline. Building on outstanding prior research, we predict that that folate deficiency and aging will limit brain circulation and oxygen delivery by diminishing microvascular plasticity, thus ultimately impairing cognition. Specific aims are to: 1) Test the hypothesis that impaired brain circulation and oxygen delivery due to aberrant microvascular plasticity impairs cognition in both folate-deficiency and aging; and 2) Identify folate- and age-responsive pathways that regulate brain microvascular plasticity. We will use a conceptually and technically innovative approach to measure cognitive function, brain microvascular plasticity, and brain circulation and oxygen delivery with our proprietary near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) system. These studies will help delineate the role of microvascular plasticity in cognitive function; establish a new animal model of vascular cognitive impairment; establish quantitative anatomical and non-invasive functional measures of microvascular health for basic and pre-clinical research; and identify one or more diet-responsive microvascular signaling pathways. These outcomes are significant because they will provide actionable insight into the role of nutritional factors in modifying microvascular plasticity for the prevention of age-related cognitive decline.\"],\n [\"EU100015\",\n\"Seismology of Stellar Coronal Oscillations\",\n\"In this project, we propose to open up the field of stellar coronal seismology. Coronal seismology is the technique that studies waves in the solar corona, and deduces difficult to measure coronal plasma parameters. Solar coronal seismology has made enormous progress in the last decade. Now is the time to export this knowledge to other stars, where coronal oscillations have also been observed.Here, we aim to construct synthetic observations for coronal oscillations, in the case when no spatial resolution is present. We will thus find the discriminating observables for different oscillation modes,  allowing for a positive mode identification in the stellar coronae. The ultimate goal of this project is to analyse archival data from XMM, COROT and Kepler to apply the stellar coronal seismology in practice.This project is constructed to allow for maximal transfer of knowledge from the previous host institution to the new host institution. This is achieved through the attraction of senior scientists for extended research visits, and through the hiring of a PhD student.\"],\n [\"EU100016\",\n\"Nice but incompetent? The eldery stereotype in Europe\",\n\"Europe\\u2019s constantly ageing population posits a number of challenges for the European Community. One of the main issues lies in shedding age discrimination that prevents the social inclusion of older people in society. A first step in doing so is to identify negative stereotypes and to uncover the mechanisms that lead to them. Past research has focused solely on psychological factors neglecting the societal context. Hence, the proposed research aims to fill this important gap by investigating the joint impact of societal and psychological variables on shaping age stereotypes and ageism. For this purpose, an explanatory model is developed and tested in a series of four cross-cultural studies.In the first phase of the project (Study 1 and 2) secondary data from the Ageism module in the European Social Survey will be analyzed. Data are available from more than 50,000 individuals coming from 28 countries in Europe. An explanatory model will be tested with the use of multilevel structural equation modeling that allows examining psychological and societal predictors simultaneously. Study 1 will focus on younger and middle-aged people\\u2019s attitudes towards the elderly by examining outcome variables such as prejudice and intergenerational contact. Study 2 will concentrate on the elderly and investigate outcome variables such as experiences of ageism and subjective well-being. In the second phase of the project, a systematic cross-cultural survey will be constructed to further investigate the impact of different societal stereotypes on real-life issues that were not assessed in the ESS. In Study 3, 400 older people from four countries will be surveyed and among others their self-esteem and willingness to engage in voluntary work will be assessed. Study 4 is a quasi-experimental field study that will be conducted in two countries. We will observe to what extent negative age stereotypes are translated into ageist behavior.\"],\n [\"EU100017\",\n\"Discovery and Insight with Advanced Models Of  Nanoscale Dimensions\",\n\"Generating knowledge about new materials and obtaining insight in their properties at the nanoscale level are highly relevant to the scientific objectives of the EU. Here, I propose to advance the current state of the art in atomistic modeling of complex systems. I aim at providing and establishing new tools that will allow for the description of large multi-component/multi-phase systems at experimental temperature and pressure with predictive power and controlled error. Generality and ease of use will be key. Building upon my experience, I have identified two clear needs that I will address. One need is a capable implementation, i.e. suitable for large condensed phase systems, of electronic structure theories that go beyond traditional DFT. Powerful linear scaling methods with excess accuracy are essential to validate, on the complex systems themselves, the use of DFT. The second need is an automatic approach for extracting empirical models from raw electronic structure data. Empirical methods are essential to perform simulations that are multiscale in time, space, and accuracy. This automatic approach must be able to generate models beyond the intuition and patience of an individual scientist using advanced optimization methods such as genetic algorithms or neural networks. Models must have a built-in estimate of their quality. The latter feature will allow for enhancing/correcting these empirical approaches automatically with first principles calculations whenever necessary. Massively parallel computing will be the enabling technology. In line with my track record, I will establish these new methods by demonstrating their potential through challenging applications. Example applications will be in diverse fields, including sustainable energy production, catalysis, environment and health. By making these tools freely and openly available to both academia and industry the benefit for the community as a whole will be significant.\"],\n [\"EU100018\",\n\"Geometry, instability and activity in complex and biological fluids\",\n\"Within the research area of soft condensed matter physics, this proposal concerns the remarkable flow (rheological) behaviour of complex fluids such as polymers, colloids and emulsions; and ofbiologically active suspensions such as swarms of bacteria or sperm, and the cytoskeletal matrix of the biological cell. A unifying concept in two closely related research themes is the waynon-equilibrium dynamics underlies the rheological behaviour of these fluids. Theme I concerns non-equilibrium phase transitions induced by an externally applied flow. It addresses the challenge of predicting the onset, characteristics and implications of these transitions in the complicated flow geometries that arise experimentally and industrially: focusing on the two key issues that will form the basis of practical rheological prediction, by addressing the key concepts of underlying physics. The first concerns the way in which geometrical confinement can lead to a rich interplay between three dimensional (3D) phase transitions in the fluid bulk, and 2D surface transitions at the hard walls of the flow device. The second concerns instabilities in extensional (stretching) flows and how they interact with transitions in shearing flows, aiming to develop a unified understanding of both, and how they interact. Theme II turns to biological suspensions that exist in strongly non-equilibrium regimes due internal activity such as bacterial swimming. While much progress has been made predicting rules for single-swimmer propulsion, and emergent phenomena of many swimmers collectively, most work to date has been in a simple (Newtonian) suspending fluid. This is a major shortcoming: most biological swimming occurs in complex polymeric fluids. My aim is to forge a physical understanding of biological activity in these complex fluid environments. Emergent phenomena include banded and turbulent flows, with an obvious link to Theme I, and an overall aim is to cross fertilise concepts between the Themes.\"],\n [\"EU100019\",\n\"The Researchers\\u2019 Night 2011 in the Czech Republic: Science Opens Spaces\",\n\"The Researchers\\u2019 Night 2011 in the Czech Republic wants to present researchers to the public in an unusual way, in the roles of amusing experiments demonstrators, moderators, musicians, photographers, informal lecturers.The partners entering this project want to play a part in changing the current public attitudes towards researchers. They welcome the opportunity to introduce researchers as people who are involved in the ordinary life the same way as the others, and to show the public how the researchers contribute to the well-being of the society.The activities planned for the event aim will bring researchers and the public together, letting them cooperate and experience amusing activities together. The visitors will discover that researchers are people whose job not only is interesting and exciting but also gives results that we utilize in our everyday life. It will be emphasized that there is no need to be a genius to become a researcher, and particularly the young visitors should leave the event convinced that a scientific career could be a choice for them when they make decisions about their professional lives.To make as many people aware of the upcoming event and to communicate the message of the event also to non-comers, awareness campaign under common motto \\u201cScience Opens Spaces\\u201d is planned for the project. The role of the European Commission in supporting this particular event will be explained and the EC will be presented as an institution that continuously and largely supports research Europe-wide.'\"],\n [\"EU100020\",\n\"The importance of submarine groundwater discharge for the southwestern Baltic Sea\",\n\"Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD), i.e. the subsurface flow of water to the sea, is now considered as an important pathway for dissolved matter transfer from the continent to the sea. Although several studies indicate that a considerable part of unmonitored waters enter the Baltic Sea, the importance of SGD is poorly studied. We propose to survey the southwestern Baltic Sea for SGD and to measure the associated fluxes of nutrients, selected major and trace elements. These studies should allow an assessment on the importance of SGD for eutrophication and thus for the coastal ecosystem in the area investigated. In order to better understand the chemical reactions determining the chemical composition of SGD we will investigate the subsurface mixing zone between freshwater and groundwater (subterranean estuary). This research will enhance our knowledge on continent-ocean connections and the expected results will be important for other coastal regions in Europe.\"],\n [\"EU100021\",\n\"DEVELOPMENT AND ENHANCEMENT OF A STEERING FEEL MODEL FOR SUPER LIGHTWEIGHT STEER-BY-WIRE VEHICLES\",\n\"The overall aim of this research is the development of a force-feedback model for the steering system of super lightweight Steer-By-Wire (SBW) vehicles. The immediate goals are to explore the role of force-feedback (a.k.a., steering feel) transmitted from the front wheels to the handwheel in road vehicles and, connectedly, to emulate and enhance the steering feel in SBW systems. More specifically, the goals are to (a) perform various driving experiments in an SBW test rig to collect input/output data from/to steering system and vehicle dynamics, (b) investigate the role of force-feedback in super lightweight vehicles so that a mathematical model for generating a proper steering feel in an SBW system can be developed, (c) investigate the cooperation of other information, which is obtained from the vehicle dynamics, with the designed steering feel model with regard to driving performance and thus enhance the steering feel, and (d) develop a steering feel model specific to a driver, through a learning algorithm, for more comfortable steering.\"],\n [\"EU100022\",\n\"International Partnership for Advanced Coatings by Thermal Spraying\",\n\"IPACTS will develop an EU-China network for surface engineering research by uniting activities among 4 top ranking European and Chinese universities.  28 researchers will be exchanged and trained with latest techniques covering the complete cycle of thermal spraying research from coating process, structure and application. IPACTS will set the foundation stones for long-term strategic collaboration between EU and China to confront the challenge of sustainable materials and low carbon-emission manufacturing in a global framework.\"],\n [\"EU100023\",\n\"Phosphorus dynamics in low-oxygen marine systems: quantifying the nutrient-climate connection in Earth\\u2019s past, present and future\",\n\"Phosphorus (P) is a key and often limiting nutrient for phytoplankton in the ocean. A strong positive feedback exists between marine P availability, primary production and ocean anoxia: increased production leads to ocean anoxia, which, in turn, decreases the burial efficiency of P in sediments and therefore increases the availability of P and production in the ocean. This feedback likely plays an important role in the present-day expansion of low-oxygen waters (\\u201cdead zones\\u201d) in coastal systems worldwide. Moreover, it contributed to the development of global scale anoxia in ancient oceans. Critically, however, the responsible mechanisms for the changes in P burial in anoxic sediments are poorly understood because of the lack of chemical tools to directly characterize sediment P. I propose to develop new methods to quantify and reconstruct P dynamics in low-oxygen marine systems and the link with carbon cycling in Earth\\u2019s present and past. These methods are based on the novel application of state-of-the-art geochemical analysis techniques to determine the burial forms of mineral-P within their spatial context in modern sediments. The new analysis techniques include nano-scale secondary ion mass spectrometry (nanoSIMS), synchotron-based scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) and laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). I will use the knowledge obtained for modern sediments to interpret sediment records of P for periods of rapid and extreme climate change in Earth\\u2019s history. Using various biogeochemical models developed in my research group, I will elucidate and quantify the role of variations in the marine P cycle in the development of low-oxygen conditions and climate change. This information is crucial for our ability to predict the consequences of anthropogenically-enhanced inputs of nutrients to the oceans combined with global warming.\"],\n [\"EU100024\",\n\"Diamond Lasers: Revolutionising Laser Engineering\",\n\"Over the last three years, synthetic single crystal diamond with high optical quality has become available for the first time. The time is thus ripe to exploit this unique material for laser engineering. Building on their pioneering work characterising, modelling and experimentally proving this material, this team will explore novel means to harness its the extraordinary properties \\u2013 a thermal conductivity that is one to two orders of magnitude greater than conventional solid-state laser materials, an extremely high rigidity, excellent resistance to mechanical stress, a wide transparency window, and very good Raman gain properties. The thermal conductivity of diamond, in particular, has the potential to revolutionise solid-state laser design. To date, the design of a solid-state laser has largely been driven by the need to manage heat \\u2013 the use of diamond can remove this requirement leading to simpler and more compact designs for high performance lasers. This programme will focus on introducing laser gain to structures based on novel high optical quality diamond. Four principal approaches will be examined:1. Developing high thermal conductivity hybrid structures by sandwiching thin slices of laser gain material between layers of diamond.2. Using the high Raman gain in diamond to develop high performance diamond Raman lasers3. Exploiting optically efficient, room-temperature colour centres in diamond to develop a revolutionary suite of broadly tuneable and ultrafast visible lasers.4. Exploring the direct doping of diamond with laser ions, building on the rapid recent progress in diamond synthesis.Encompassing laser physics, materials science and device engineering, this programme will balance risk and reward to help position Europe as the world-leader in laser engineering. The lasers developed will be important tools in vital sectors such as science (e.g. biological imaging), energy (e.g. wind speed sensing) and medicine (e.g. treating vascular lesions).\"],\n [\"EU100025\",\n\"Electrochemistry in fluidic nanodevices: From fundamentals to integrated sensor platforms\",\n\"I propose to explore the frontiers of electrochemistry at the nanometer scale by developing new experimental approaches based on lithographically fabricated fluidic nanodevices. This will allow groundbreaking experiments on a broad range of fundamental topics including double layer structure, screening in ionic liquids, nanoscale hydrodynamics and the dielectric response of single macromolecules. It will also lay the foundations for new analytical techniques based on electrochemical single molecule recognition and targeted at integration with state-of-the-art electronics on a single chip. The latter combination could potentially bring about a revolution in (bio)sensing technology on a scale comparable to those which have already taken place in computing and communications. My first focus will be on nanofabricating sub-femtolitre channels and chambers in which single or small numbers of redox-active molecules can be detected and manipulated using electrochemistry at pairs of embedded electrodes. Simultaneously, I will explore the capabilities electrochemical impedance spectroscopy using nanoelectrodes at frequencies up to 200 MHz. Such a combination of ultra-short length scales and high frequencies has heretofore remained inaccessible and will be made possible here by using electrodes that form an intrinsic part of an integrated detection circuit. This research has a truly exploratory character, as few investigators so far have attempted to combine nanofluidics, modern microelectronics and electrochemistry. Doing so will test our microscopic understanding of electrochemical processes, enable new classes of experiments, and push the limits of electrochemistry as an analytical method. There is thus a high likelihood that further new concepts and applications will emerge over the course of this multidisciplinary program.\"],\n [\"EU100026\",\n\"Quantitative Graph Games: Theory and Applications\",\n\"The theory of games played on graphs provides the mathematical foundations to study numerous important problems in branches of mathematics, economics, computer science, biology, and other fields. One key application area in computer science is the formal verification of reactive systems. The system is modeled as a graph, in which vertices of the graph represent states of the system, edges represent transitions, and paths represent behavior of the system. The verification of the system in an arbitrary environment is then studied as a problem of game played on the graph, where the players represent the different interacting agents. Traditionally, these games have been studied either with Boolean objectives, or single quantitative objectives. However, for the problem of verification of systems that must behave correctly in resource-constrained environments (such as an embedded system) both Boolean and quantitative objectives are necessary: the Boolean objective for correctness specification and quantitative objective for resource-constraints. Thus we need to generalize the theory of graph games such that the objectives can express combinations of quantitative and Boolean objectives. In this project, we will focus on the following research objectives for the study of graph games with quantitative objectives:(1) develop the mathematical theory and algorithms for the new class of games on graphs obtained by combining quantitative and Boolean objectives;(2) develop practical techniques (such as compositional and abstraction techniques) that allow our algorithmic solutions be implemented efficiently to handle large game graphs;(3) explore new application areas to demonstrate the application of quantitative graph games in diverse disciplines; and(4) develop the theory of games on graphs with infinite state space and with quantitative objectives.since the theory of graph games is foundational in several disciplines, new algorithmic solutions are expected.\"],\n [\"EU100027\",\n\"The Gamma Ray Burst \\u2013 Supernova Connectionand Shock Breakout Physics\",\n\"Long gamma ray bursts (long GRBs) and core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are two of the most spectacular explosions in the Universe. They are a focal point of research for many reasons. Nevertheless, despite considerable effort during the last several decades, there are still many fundamental open questions regarding their physics.Long GRBs and CCSNe are related. We know that they are both an outcome of a massive star collapse, where in some cases, such collapse produces simultaneously a GRB and a SN. However, we do not know how a single stellar collapse can produce these two apparently very different explosions.  The GRB-SN connection raises many questions, but it also offers new opportunities to learn on the two types of explosions.The focus of the proposed research is on the connection between CCSNe and GRBs, and on the physics of shock breakout.  As I explain in this proposal, shock breakouts play an important role in this connection and therefore, I will develop a comprehensive theory of relativistic and Newtonian shock breakout. In addition, I will study the propagation of relativistic jets inside stars, including the effects of jet propagation and GRB engine on the emerging SN. This will be done by a set of interrelated projects that carefully combine analytic calculations and numerical simulations. Together, these projects will be the first to model a GRB and a SN that are simultaneously produced in a single star. This in turn will be used to gain new insights into long GRBs and CCSNe in general.This research will also make a direct contribution to cosmic explosions research in general. Any observable cosmic explosion must go through a shock breakout and a considerable effort is invested these days in large field of view surveys in search for these breakouts. This program will provide a new theoretical base for the interpretation of the upcoming observations.\"],\n [\"EU100028\",\n\"Integrated Ground and on-Board system for Support of the Aircraft Safe Take-off and Landing\",\n\"The future air transport system will be confronted with new challenges: it must be safer, greener and more effective than the current system. There will be more global industrial competition and fossil fuel reserves will diminish leading to increased fuel prices. New radical ideas, methods and technologies are needed to respond to these challenges and to keep Europe world leader in aviation. One of the ideas that came from the Out of the Box project was to launch and recover aircraft by using ground-based power. Several ideas were proposed like using microwave power technology, hoisting aircraft in the air, aircraft carriers type of aircraft launch and recovery etc.The GABRIEL proposal is based on a system using magnetic levitation technology to enable aircraft take-off and landing. This unique solution will reduce aircraft fuel consumption since aircraft weight can be reduced as no undercarriage will be needed,  less fuel needs to be carried onboard and engines can be smaller as less thrust is needed. Using ground power will also reduce CO2 and NOx emissions at airports whilst noise levels can be substantially reduced since only airframe noise will be produced  during take-off. Airport capacity can be increased by introducing multiple launch and recovery ramps thus alleviating the problem of limited runway capacity in Europe.Gabriel will investigate if such a system is feasible and cost effective.Magnetic levitation is already a developed and deployed technology in rail transportation. However, research is needed to prove the technical feasibility of the concept in air transportation. GABRIEL will investigate how to adapt the existing magnetic levitation technology and to redesign the aircraft and more particularly its fuselage. The project will also study the feasibility of launch and recovery in connection to operating limits and aircraft flight controls. Operational and safety issues will be studied extensively. A small scale test will be designed to validate, assess the feasibility and estimate the limits of the assisted take-off and landing concept. The issue of emergency landings will be addressed.The project will also perform an extensive cost benefit analysis, covering the effects on fuel savings, environmental benefits, new airport infrastructures and the required power supply.The GABRIEL is a typical \\u201cout of the box\\u201d project that involves 12 partners from 7 European countries. The project will last for 36 months.'\"],\n [\"EU100029\",\n\"METABOLIC CONTROL OF IMMATURE STROMAL CELL BIOLOGY\",\n\"A very recent literature claims that metabolic status represents a crucial regulatory mechanism that helps direct stem cells fate. Whereas mainly described on the well characterized hematopoietic stem cells population, such metabolic investigations have been poorly conducted on another key population of adult immature cells that populate the stromal compartment of all tissues, i.e. the mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (MSC). Among them, adipose-derived stromal/stem cells (ASC) have been defined both as multipotent precursors and as supporting cells through their high secretory and immunomodulatory properties. These ASC hallmarks explain their potent regenerative capacities and have prompted clinical studies on their therapeutic potential. However, the mechanisms that govern their plasticity and fate as well as their interactions with other cell populations still remain to be unravelled. Along with ASC, adipose tissue harbours other immature populations whose biology is poorly described. The main objective of this METABOSTEM project is to investigate the role of metabolism in the intrinsic biology and fate of immature stromal populations residing within adipose tissue. Based on neuron-astrocyte and cancer cells models, we hypothesize that supporting cells such as ASC control the surrounding immature populations through a metabolic coupling, representing a new and primitive mechanism by which stromal compartment could control stem cells biology within the niche. This interdisciplinary project will integrate different scientific fields and techniques together such as in situ analysis, metabolic characterisation and stem cell biology, using murine adipose tissue as a working model. The METABOSTEM proposal will hopefully help at a better understanding of the biology of immature stromal cells from adipose tissue, both in physiological and regenerative conditions, and will have larger consequences on the way to manipulate and expand them.'\"],\n [\"EU100030\",\n\"Remote Laser Welding System Navigator for Eco & Resilient Automotive Factories\",\n\"RLW Navigator aims to develop an innovative Process Navigator to configure, integrate, test and validate applications of Remote Laser Welding (RLW) in automotive assembly addressing today's critical needs for frequently changing operating conditions and product-mix provisions. Thus, RLW Navigator will crucially serve as an enabler for future energy efficient smart factories. RLW is emerging as a promising joining technology for sheet metal assembly due to benefits on several fronts including reduced processing time, (50-75%) and decreased factory floor footprint (50%), reduced environmental impact through energy use reduction (60%), and providing a flexible process base for future model introduction or product change. Currently, RLW systems are limited in their applicability due to an acute lack of systematic ICT-based simulation methodologies to navigate their efficient application in automotive manufacturing processes. The project aims to address this by developing a Process Navigator simulation system that will deal with three key challenges thereby allowing manufacturers to utilize the advantages of the RLW system.Firstly, the most critical obstacle that currently prevents the successful implementation of RLW is the need for tight dimensional control of part-to-part gap during joining operations, essential to ensure the quality of the stitch.Secondly, the existing assembly system architecture must be reconfigured to provide the opportunity to evaluate the RLW system in terms of its feasibility to perform all required assembly tasks. This will provide crucial information about the most advantageous workstation/cell reconfiguration, which will serve as the basis for optimal robot path planning to reduce joining process time and workstation level efficiency assessment.Finally the project will develop systematic evaluation and learning methods to assess and improve the overall performance, cost-effectiveness and eco-efficiency of the RLW system.\"],\n [\"EU100031\",\n\"EUropean DATa\",\n\"EUDAT is our proposal for the next stage in the realisation of the vision of 'data as infrastructure'. The EUDAT consortium includes representatives from each stage of the value chain that has evolved to deliver scientific knowledge to researchers, citizens, industry and society as a whole. It includes funding agencies that invest in research infrastructures and programmes of research, infrastructure operators and research communities who rely on the availability of data-management services, national data centres and providers of connectivity and, of course, the users who rely on the availability of data and services, innovators who add value to the raw results of scientific research.<br/>EUDAT is a three-year project that will deliver a Collaborative Data Infrastructure (CDI) with the capacity and capability for meeting future researchers' needs in a sustainable way. Its design will reflect a comprehensive picture of the data service requirements of the research communities in Europe and beyond. This will become increasingly important over the next decade as we face the challenges of massive expansion in the volume of data being generated and preserved (the so-called 'data tsunami') and in the complexity of that data and the systems required to provide access to it.<br/>Although those user requirements will vary between scientific disciplines, the micro-systems from which each community's services are built are largely generic.  This commonality will make it easier to achieve the minimum critical mass of users necessary for significant economies of scale to be achieved. The ability to rapidly provide bespoke responses to the evolving needs of our research communities additionally strengthens the business case for those communities.  With the inclusion of disciplines from across the spectrum of scientific endeavour sharing a common infrastructure, EUDAT also provides the opportunity for data-sharing between disciplines and cross-fertilisation of ideas.\"],\n [\"EU100032\",\n\"Multi-Core Execution of Parallelised Hard Real-Time Applications Supporting Analysability\",\n\"Engineers who design hard real-time embedded systems express a need for several times the performance available today while keeping safety as major criterion. A breakthrough in performance is expected by parallelising hard real-time applications. parMERASA targets a timing analysable system of parallel hard real-time applications running on a scalable multi-core processor. Several new scientific and technical challenges will be tackled in the light of timing analysability: parallelisation techniques for industrial applications, operating system virtualisation and efficient synchronisation mechanisms, guarantee of worst-case execution times (WCET) of parallelised applications, verification and profiling tools, and scalable memory hierarchies together with I/O systems for multi-core processors.The output of parMERASA will be at least an eightfold performance improvement of the WCET for parallelised legacy applications in avionics, automotive, and construction machinery domains in comparison to the original sequential versions. The execution platform, i.e. the parMERASA multi-core processor and system software, will provide temporal and spatial isolation between tasks and scale up to 64 cores. A software engineering approach will be taken targeting at least four parallel execution patterns that are analysable. Verification and profiling tools will be developed, and we aim to provide at least four recommendations to enhance both automotive and avionic standards.parMERASA will impact new products for transportation systems and industrial applications. It will impact standards by introducing parallel execution and time predictability as key features. This will contribute to reinforce the EC position in the field of critical computing systems and yield an advantage for European industry in the highly competitive avionics, automotive, and construction machinery markets.\"],\n [\"EU100033\",\n\"EU-INdia Fostering COOPeration in Computing Systems\",\n\"The EU-INCOOP project objective is to stimulate cooperation in the computing technologies between Europe and India, in order to support Europe's leading position in computing system, while ensuring mutual benefits for both Europe and India.The project intends to take a 'consensus building approach' by bringing together researchers and stakeholders from both regions under a common forum for discussing and analysing research agendas in computing systems.Through the sequence of structured workshops, channels of communication will be established between the provider constituency, and the research community.

The transport sector by itself consumes up to ~30% of the total energy in the EU. These figures suggest that if Europe is to reduce its CO2 emissions by making an efficient use of energy while improving the quality of life in European cities, novel approaches for the optimal management of urban transport complexity must be developed and adopted in the transport sector.<br/>MODUM addresses the environmental footprint in the transport sector by aiming to develop a new approach for pro-active demand-responsive management of traffic to enable energy-efficient multi-modal transport choices accommodating dynamic variations, minimising the environmental impact and improving the quality of life in urban environments. Moreover, MODUM will consider commuters, in combinations of both private and public transport, facing dynamic conditions such as unexpected disturbances typical of urban environments.<br/>In particular, MODUM focuses on the comparison and then the potential synthesis of two approaches: 1) a traffic flow self-organising mechanism based on ant-like agent technology and 2) a 'reverse' route planning based on software agent technology; using real-time data and declared destinations. Both mechanisms have proven successful in other application domains and have the potential of utilising vehicles' computational power and networking capabilities for achieving their active participation in the demand-response management of urban traffic.<br/>The metrics for the comparison will be extracted from real needs of traffic control centres and from transport users in our selected cities. Once the metrics are defined, a series of simulation experiments of realistic complexity will be constructed using real-time data feeds available from transport sensing infrastructure. Results from these will profile the two approaches against certain scenarios of traffic disturbances causing rapid changes in conditions. A synthesis of the two approaches will then be developed by the academic partners.<br/>Software implementation of the synthesised approach will then be embarked upon, focusing on the telecommunication challenges of a realistic demonstrator. The developed prototype will be validated on the initial scenarios by staging real-life experiments, which the relevant traffic management structures within the traffic control centres will evaluate. Such experiments will include historical data and simulations in combination with real-time data feeds from existing infrastructure and vehicles going through a section of a city in a number of congestion profiles. Analogous experiments will include people moving in a city by different means of transport.<br/>The prototype will provide an implementation of an optimisation approach to traffic management capable of dynamically adapting the overall flows of traffic to unexpected disturbances to minimise carbon emissions within an urban complex environment.

The current strategy to minimize potential placebo effects largely ignores the positive effects of the placebo response. The current proposal postulates a radically different approach: Instead of considering placebo effects a nuisance, we will explicitly investigate the mechanisms behind expectation and experience (i.e. placebo response) to develop its use for the benefit of the patient. Importantly, the same applies to the effect of negative expectations (i.e. nocebo response) that can be responsible for negative effects of treatment. Understanding the mechanisms and circumstances that promote these effects will allow us to adjust medical treatments to minimize these nocebo effects. We will investigate the mechanisms of placebo and nocebo responses in traditional fields such as pain, but also in respiratory medicine and in \\u201ccognitive enhancement\\u201d. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), pharmacological interventions and formal models we will in particular address the neuronal mechanisms underlying placebo and nocebo responses. Combining the data from all three fields (pain, respiration and cognitive enhancement) will allow us to identify domain general and domain specific mechanisms of placebo responses. These projects will be supported by a methodological work-package which will provide neuroimaging techniques to improve the assessment of placebo and nocebo relevant brain structures. Finally a large cohort of volunteers will be investigated, to assess the relationship between placebo responses, personality variables and genetic polymorphisms using a genome-wide association analysis. Insights gained in this project could have the potential to formally place placebo responses and related mechanisms such as experience and expectation into the mainstream of evidence based medicine.\"],\n [\"EU100039\",\n\"CloudIX: Cloud-based Indexing and Query Processing\",\n\"The advent of cloud computing comprises a new paradigm that entails a large number of low-end processors that perform parallel processing of (usually data-intensive and resource-demanding) computing jobs. This is particularly appealing for a wide variety of data-intensive applications, including scientific data management, analysis and mining of complex data, and internet-scale service provisioning. Nevertheless, processing complex queries in the cloud is still in a primitive stage, largely relying on the concept of map-reduce, without inherent indexing mechanisms that can boost the performance of query processing. In contrast, database research prides itself on scalable techniques for advanced query processing.CloudIX intends to transfer knowledge from data management technology to the cloud infrastructure, in order to support advanced query processing. To this end, CloudIX aims to propose a generic, distributed, dynamic and adaptive indexing framework for handling multidimensional data in the cloud. Capitalizing on this indexing infrastructure, CloudIX will present novel efficient algorithms for processing advanced query types, such as range, nearest-neighbor, top-k, rank joins, and skyline queries. Furthermore, CloudIX will propose new economical cost models that need to be tightly integrated in the process of query optimization.The research results of CloudIX are expected to act as a catalyst that attracts applications that rely on advanced query processing to be moved to the cloud. As a showcase scenario, two applications will be deployed on top of CloudIX, one related with scientific data management, to demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed framework.\"],\n [\"EU100040\",\n\"The genomic basis of emerging fungal pathogenicity\",\n\"In the study of human pathogens most of the attention has been given to viral and bacterial species, and fungi have been largely neglected. To date there is no broad, large-scale census of the genomic elements shared by fungal pathogenic species. Also, no large-scale scan for selective pressure variability has been undertaken, even though all the elements are in place to do so. There has neither been a multi-species search for conserved noncoding elements that may be key to explaining the regulation of crucially important functional elements and networks. The overall goal of this study is to gain insight on the evolution of the genomic elements involved in fungal human pathogenicity through the analysis of the selective constraints acting on coding and noncoding sequences. For this purpose we will combine genome sequencing, transcriptomics (RNA-seq), comparative genomics and evolutionary analyses. This project will throw light on fundamental questions about the key genes, regulatory elements and phenotypic traits that are involved in infection or how emergent, opportunistic pathogens originate relatively rapidly from non-pathogenic ancestors. Finally, the list of identified relevant genes and regulatory elements can provide much needed targets for developing pharmaceutical and therapeutic strategies.\"],\n [\"EU100041\",\n\"New Tools for Real-Time Cellular Imaging and Protein Labelling\",\n\"The primary aim of the proposed research is to develop smart new imaging tools and reagents for real-time in situ monitoring of specific cellular processes both in vitro and in vivo, with a particular focus on lung function and apoptosis/inflammation. The methods and tools currently available to define the inflammatory/infective state in lung tissues are limited and crude. Therefore, I will design, synthesise and validate novel clinical molecular imaging probes which can, in the future, be used to define the inflammatory and infective aetiology of lung infiltrates in intensive care unit patients. These dual probes would allow clinicians in intensive care units to rapidly and accurately determine the aetiology of deteriorating respiratory function or clinical status of the patient. These activity-based probes are designed to detect caspase, human neutraphil elastase as well as bacterial presence and activity in the target tissue. The research will be conducted at the interface of chemistry, biology and pre-clinical medicine, with molecules being made and then directly applied in pertinent in vivo models.

The most striking example is photosynthesis, in which plants, algae and bacteria are able to transfer the absorbed light to the reaction centers in proteins with almost 100% quantum efficiency. Recent two-dimensional spectroscopic measurements suggest that the role of the environment (a protein or a given embedding supramolecular architecture) is fundamental in determining both the dynamics and the efficiency of the process. What is still missing in order to fully understand and characterize EET is a new theoretical and computational approach which can reproduce the microscopic dynamics of the process based on an accurate description of the playing actors, i.e. the transferring pigments and the environment. Such an approach is a formidable challenge due to the large network of interactions which couples all the parts and makes the dynamics of the process a complex competition of random fluctuations and coherences. Only a strategy based upon an integration of computational models with different length and time scales can achieve the required completeness of the description. This project aims at achieving such an integration by developing completely new theoretical and computational tools based on the merging of quantum mechanical methods, polarizable force fields and dielectric continuum models. Such a strategy in which the fundamental effects of polarization between the pigments and the environment will be accounted for in a dynamically coupled way will allow to simulate the full dynamic process of light harvesting and energy transfer in complex multichromophoric supramolecular systems.\"],\n [\"EU100043\",\n\"Basic Research in Cryptographic Protocol Theory\",\n\"In cryptographic protocol theory, we consider a situation where a number of entities want to solve some problem over a computer network. Each entity has some secret data it does not want the other entities to learn, yet, they all want to learn something about the common set of data. In an electronic election, they want to know the number of yes-votes without revealing who voted what. For instance, in an electronic auction, they want to find the winner without leaking the bids of the losers.A main focus of the project is to develop new techniques for solving such protocol problems. We are in particular interested in techniques which can automatically construct a protocol solving a problem given only a description of what the problem is. My focus will be theoretical basic research, but I believe that advancing the theory of secure protocol compilers will have an immense impact on the practice of developing secure protocols for practice.When one develops complex protocols, it is important to be able to verify their correctness before they are deployed, in particular so, when the purpose of the protocols is to protect information. If and when an error is found and corrected, the sensitive data will possibly already be compromised. Therefore, cryptographic protocol theory develops models of what it means for a protocol to be secure, and techniques for analyzing whether a given protocol is secure or not.A main focuses of the project is to develop better security models, as existing security models either suffer from the problem that it is possible to prove some protocols secure which are not secure in practice, or they suffer from the problem that it is impossible to prove security of some protocol which are believed to be secure in practice. My focus will again be on theoretical basic research, but I believe that better security models are important for advancing a practice where protocols are verified as secure before deployed.\"],\n [\"EU100044\",\n\"Investigating Functional Dynamics in Proteins by Novel Multidimensional Optical Spectroscopies in the Ultraviolet\",\n\"Proteins perform their biological function following specific sequences of events. During these dynamical paths, highly non-trivial cooperative interactions occur. Ultimately, this is the origin of the emerging collective behavior that makes proteins the most sophisticated existing molecular machines. This complex network of processes covers a wide range of timescales, from few fs to ms, and distances, from atoms to large protein domains.Even the most recent experimental techniques generally provide ns-to-us averaged structural and dynamical information, often in non-physiological conditions. To access simultaneously atomic time and length scales would unveil the elementary conformational steps constituting a functional event and their temporal evolution.I propose to extend emerging multidimensional ultrafast optical spectroscopic techniques to the deep ultraviolet. These techniques are the analogue of multidimensional Nuclear Magnetic Resonance methods and are able to provide structural information exploiting electric dipole couplings but with fs temporal resolution. The novel extension to ultraviolet, that I shall implement, will open the possibility to exploit the optical absorption of aromatic amino-acid residues with the great advantage of studying wild type proteins. In this way, all drawbacks due to artificial labeling will be ruled out. I will use this new technique to study dynamic-assisted long range electron transfer in copper proteins and enzyme regulation in hemoglobin. These two proteins of great importance from a biological point of view have been chosen because their functions are a clear manifestation of cooperative phenomena. On a long term prospective this methodology will be a universal tool applicable to any wild type protein containing aromatic amino acids.\"],\n [\"EU100045\",\n\"Towards compressive information processing systems\",\n\"This proposal targets the emerging frontier research field of compressive sampling (CS), and particularly its application in the framework of complex information processing systems, including several related innovative and unconventional aspects. Future systems will have to handle unprecedented amounts of information such as those generated in multiview video, medical and hyperspectral imaging applications, increasingly suffering from limited communication and computational resources. CS is a breakthrough technology that will have a profound impact on how these systems are conceived. It offers a viable and elegant solution, acquiring and representing an information signal through a small set of linear projections of it, allowing to dramatically reduce communication, storage and processing requirements, and is one of the topics that will dominate signal processing research in the next years. At the core of this research proposal is the concept of employing CS not only as a standalone tool, but inside an information processing system. The main challenge is to develop theory and algorithms that will allow to perform all signal manipulations typical of conventional systems directly on the linear measurements, as reconstructing the signal samples would be unfeasible due to excessive complexity. Such operations include compression, encryption, communication, reconstruction, signal analysis, information extraction and decision, and distributed signal processing, leading to a very multidisciplinary and technically challenging research agenda. Ultimately, our research aims at developing and demonstrating the fundamental tools that will fuel next-generation information processing systems with an order-of-magnitude better performance at a lower cost than today.

These quantum memories will be used to explore new avenues in the quantum control of matter-matter entanglement. Progress beyond the state of the art will go along three ways: (1) the demonstration of long lived and robust entanglement between two remote solid state quantum memories. These systems will facilitate the scalability and integration in large scale quantum networks. (2)  The demonstration of a quantum gate between two collective matter qubits stored in cold atomic ensembles. This requires the quantum control of single collective atomic Rydberg excitations. (3) The demonstration of entanglement between a solid state quantum memory and a cold atomic ensemble.

However, if economic and political vulnerabilities are included as contributing factors, agricultural bioterrorism must be considered among other possible avenues of attack.Agricultural bioterrorism (agroterrorism) is a subset of bioterrorism, and it is defined as the deliberate introduction of an animal or plant disease/pest with the goal of generating fear, causing economic losses, and/or undermining stability.Programmes preparing for attacks against agriculture are not new, and have been conducted both by nation-states and by substate organizations throughout history. At least nine countries (Canada, France, Germany, Iraq, Japan, South Africa, United Kingdom, USA and the former USSR) had documented agricultural bioweapons programmes during some part of the 20th century. Four other countries (Egypt, North Korea, Rhodesia and Syria) are believed to have or have had agricultural bioweapons programmes.In the mean time, natural outbreaks of diseases demonstrate the destructive potential of an agroterroristic attack.Recent trends in biosecurity recommend a shift from a largely national approach to biosecurity towards greater international cooperation. Current capabilities to detect and respond to agroterrorism are limited and spread among many organizations, with a corresponding lack of coordination.The project deals with threats which are multifaceted, interrelated, complex and increasingly transnational in their impact. The European Network of Excellence PLANTFOODSEC aims to establish a virtual Centre of Competence in plant and food biosecurity to enhance preparedness and response capabilities to prevent, to respond and to recover from a biological incident or deliberate criminal activity threatening the European agrifood system.\"],\n [\"EU100054\",\n\"Creation of a distributed European Magnetic Field Laboratory\",\n\"The Radboud University Nijmegen, operating the High Field Magnet laboratory (HFML, for continuous magnetic fields), the Forschungszentrum Dresden-Rossendorf, operating the Hochfeld-Magnetlabor Dresden (HLD, for pulsed magnetic fields), and the Conseil National de la Recherche Scientifique, operating the Laboratoire National de Champs Magn\\u00e9tiques Intenses in Grenoble and Toulouse (LNCMI-G for continuous and LNCMI-T for pulsed magnetic fields), undertake a study how to organize and operate, under one umbrella, the European Magnetic Field Laboratory (EMFL).This study will investigate all legal, financial, organisatorial and employment related issues, and formulate a document for the founding agreement of the EMFL of the 3 partners, or any other stakeholders that may be identified.Different work packages will provide studies of the feasibility and cost of all the proposed investments in the new EMFL, and develop the in-house knowledge base for the investments, and harmonize experimental capabilities at the infrastructures. A web page and material will be developed  for communication with the user community and the public. The coupling of high magnetic fields with advanced light sources will be investigated and how joint operation of different infrastructures can be organised, and a future roadmap for EMFL established.\"],\n [\"EU100055\",\n\"TOWARDS A JOINT EUROPEAN RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE NETWORK FOR COASTAL OBSERVATORIES\",\n\"Around European coastal seas, the number of marine observing systems is quickly increasing under the pressure of both monitoring requirements and oceanographic research. Present demands for such systems include reliable, high-quality and comprehensive observations, automated platforms and sensors systems, as well as autonomy over long time periods. In-situ data collected, combined with remote sensing and models output, contribute to detect, understand and forecast the most crucial coastal processes over extensive areas within the various national and regional marine environments.Coastal observations are an important part of the marine research puzzle of activities and applications. However significant heterogeneity exists in Europe concerning technological design of observing systems, measured parameters, practices for maintenance and quality control, as well as quality standards for sensors and data exchange. Up to now, the expansion of \\u201ccoastal observatories\\u201d has been driven by domestic interests and mainly undertaken through short-term research projects. Therefore the main challenge for the research community is now to increase the coherence and the sustainability of these dispersed infrastructures by addressing their future within a shared pan-European framework.This is the main objective of JERICO, which proposes a Pan European approach for a European coastal marine observatory network, integrating infrastructure and technologies such as moorings, drifters, ferrybox and gliders. Networking activities will lead to the definitions of best practices for design, implementation, maintenance and distribution of data of coastal observing systems, as well as the definition of a quality standard. Harmonisation and strengthening coastal observation systems within EuroGOOS regions will be sought.Unique twin Trans National Access experiments will be carried out in order to reveal the potential of datasets used in synergy. Central coastal infrastructure in Europe will be opened for international research. This will among other benefits GMES and European contribution to climate change research.New joint research will be conducted in order to identify new and strategic technologies to be implemented in the next generation European coastal observatories. Focus is given on emerging technologies and the biochemical compartment.JERICO intends to contribute to the international and global effort on climate change research (GEOSS), to provide coastal data inputs for operational ocean observing and forecasting, and also to answer to some of the needs of the environmental research and societal communities.\"],\n [\"EU100056\",\n\"Data without Boundaries\",\n\"While access to anonymised official microdata for researchers is still uneven both at national and at European level, access to highly detailed and sensitive microdata is now increasingly on the agenda. Different member states have substantially different outcomes for research access to Official data, and the issue is not just efficiency, but real harm to the contribution of the social sciences to democracy in an information society. Therefore the primary impact of this application is to prepare the essential relationships and build trust, common view and agreements on standards between the European Statistical System led by Eurostat, other stakeholders as the Central banks, the Data Archives European network (CESSDA) and the researchers who are the final users; from access as a postcode lottery, to an integrated model where the best solutions for access are available irrespective of national boundaries and are flexible enough to fit national arrangements. It aims at a) discussing frameworks and proposing pilots for a European accreditation and a distributed remote access for confidential microdata to be expanded later to other partners, both for national and European datasets; b) fostering discussions and promoting improvements and solutions for the entire communities through annual/bi-annual European data Forum, regional workshops, users conferences, training sessions, staff visits c) preparing an easy and single point of access (What data are available? How can I access them?) for the  researchers, to be linked to the CESSDA portal where NSIs metadata could be harvested when not available through the CESSDA archives still providing access to official microdata; d) immediately enhancing access to official data making European datasets more useable (metadata, routines) and supporting foreign researchers transnational access both on site and through remote access system to countries official microdata. Close coordination with the European Statistical System discussions and initiatives as well as with on-going and future related projects is developed to ensure maximum synergy and incorporation of outputs.\"],\n [\"EU100057\",\n\"The association between type 2 diabetes diagnosis and diabetes medications with risk of cancer\",\n\"Type 2 diabetes and cancer are two chronic diseases that negatively influence the survival of millions of people worldwide. Diabetes has been shown in meta-analyses to be associated with an increased risk of several cancers, but these associations are not yet documented as causal. The evidence for specific diabetes drugs affecting cancer risk is limited, because randomized clinical trials are not designed to evaluate specifically cancer outcomes, and observational studies are often confounded by indications for specific drugs. We propose to better characterize the degree of involvement of type 2 diabetes diagnosis and pharmacologic treatment in cancer initiation or progression. Therefore, we will a) evaluate bias and credibility in the existing meta-analyses of diabetes diagnosis and cancer risk, b) determine whether diabetes diagnosis is associated with risk of prostate cancer using the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort, c) perform a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials and observational studies that have evaluated the association  between diabetes medications and cancer risk, and d) evaluate the association between diabetes drugs and cancer risk (separately by site) using the UK-based General Practice Research Database. Cutting-edge evidence synthesis methods (Harbord\\u2019s test, excess significance bias test, credibility ceilings) will be used in our first aim, and summary meta-analytic estimates will be calculated in our third aim using random effects models. An incident diabetes drug cohort design with adherence-adjusted intention-to-treat style of analysis will be used in aim 4, while Cox proportional hazards models will be used in both aims 2 and 4. The proposed project will have major impact in the field, because the literature on diabetes diagnosis, treatment on cancer risk will be properly evaluated, and these associations will be further assessed in two large, unique prospective studies.\"],\n [\"EU100058\",\n\"Oxysterols and IL-27-induced Type 1 regulatory T cells in Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis\",\n\"Accumulating evidence indicates that cholesterol metabolism plays a major role during acquired immune response. Cholesterol metabolites oxysterols have recently been proposed to be involved in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS), considered to be the first cause of neurologic disability among young adults in occidental countries. MS is characterized by demyelination throughout the central nervous system associated with inflammatory infiltrates of lymphocytic and mononuclear cell. The balance between pathogenicity of effector T cells and negative regulation imposed by regulatory T cells plays a major role in its development. Two important classes of regulatory T cells within the CD4\\\\ subset are the Foxp3\\\\ T-cells (Tregs) and IL-10-producing type 1 regulatory T cells (Tr1). Interest in Tr1 cells was revived with the discovery that they could be differentiated with the cytokine IL-27. This provided impetus to evaluate the potential of IL-27-induced Tr1 cells in autoimmune diseases. Here we propose to study the role oxysterol during Tr1 cell differentiation. We recently performed a screening for different oxysterols converting enzymes during T cell differentiation and found that IL-27 specifically induced the membrane-associated enzyme CH25H. Based on these results, we first propose to study how modulation of CH25H and its product, 25-hydroxycholesterol, influences Tr1 cell biology in vitro and in vivo using the murine model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. We further aim to dissect the molecular pathways by which oxysterols modulates Tr1 cells in order to define new putative pharmaceutical targets to enhance Tr1 cell number and function. Indeed, this project will help unravel the role of cholesterol metabolites during CD4\\\\ T cells differentiation and will assess their importance in the control of Tr1 cells during autoimmune diseases.\"],\n [\"EU100059\",\n\"Mechanisms of Inflammation Resolution: Role of miRNAs\",\n\"The elucidation of endogenous pathways and chemical mediators that activate resolution of inflammation is crucial to identify new therapeutic approaches to control excessive inflammation and related diseases. Inflammation and resolution are actively regulated processes, during which a temporal switch in leukocyte populations present in the exudates occurs, likely reflecting changes in bone marrow (BM) hematopoietic stem cells (HSC). Biosynthesis of the specialized pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPM) lipoxin (LX) A4 and resolvin (Rv) D1 also occurs. SPM promote inflammation resolution by regulating leukocyte trafficking as well as the expression of selected microRNAs (miRNAs) via the G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) FPR2/ALX and GPR32.Here, we propose to investigate: 1) Whether resolution is regulated at the BM level by specific proresolving miRNAs, whose expression is modulated by LXA4 and RvD1; 2) Which processes are controlled by these miRNAs.We plan to achieve the outlined specific aims by a system approach to inflammation and resolution. Using self-limited murine peritonitis, we will identify SPM-regulated miRNAs by analyzing temporal changes in the miRNA profile of BM HSC, at resting and upon exposure to LXA4 and RvD1. GPCR-dependence of LXA4 and RvD1 actions will be assessed in experiments with FPR2/ALX or GPR32 recombinant cells. A gain of function approach will be employed to identify target genes of proresolving miRNAs, and assess their roles in HSC differentiation and inflammation. Results from these experiments will help to elucidate key pathways that can be exploited to introduce innovative therapeutic strategies to treat inflammation-related diseases in humans by promoting resolution.Funding this proposal will reinforce excellence and competitiveness of European research and contribute to the reintegration of the proponent after a period of mobility.\"],\n [\"EU100060\",\n\"Common assessment and analysis of risk in global supply chains\",\n\"The challenges facing international intermodal container logistics is efficiency and security. These seemingly conflicting issues have a common solution: supply chain visibility, where data for visibility can be shared between business and government.Since technical solutions already exist, the challenge lies in integrating solutions across the supply chain. CASSANDRA will:\\u2022Facilitate the adoption of a risk based approach in the supply chain, on the basis of integral monitoring data on cargo flows and container integrity,\\u2022Build interfaces between existing visibility solutions, and visualisation tools, in an open rchitecture,\\u2022Demonstrate the integration of data and risk assessment in supply chains in three major trading routes to and from Europe\\u2022Evaluate the quality of the integral data with business and government.\\u2022Facilitate a dialogue between business and government to gain consensus on the criteria for data sharing between business and government.The project participants cover all relevant stakeholders, including some global players.

The value drivers in CASSANDRA will include:\\u2022Logistics efficiency benefits\\u2022Security benefits for business as a result of the risk self assessment\\u2022Security benefits for government as a result of the high quality and complete data for government risk analysis.CASSANDRA will contribute to the priorities of DG TAXUD, will facilitate security and crime-fighting priorities of DG Enterprise and DG Justice, Liberty and Security, and enables priorities in the DG TREN Freight Logistics Action Plan, and builds on previous work in standardisation bodies.The development of integral supply chain data that is the basis for risk based supply chain management and the input for government supervision tasks, as envisaged in CASSANDRA, will set a new standard for global door-to-door goods flows to and from Europe: efficient & secure!\"],\n [\"EU100061\",\n\"Socialism and leftist Catholicism in France and Italy (1956-1972)\",\n\"The SOCIALCATH research project deals with the intercultural connection between Socialism and Catholicism in two cases in which this meeting was very evident: the French 'Parti Socialiste Unifi\\u00e9' (PSU) and the Italian 'Partito Socialista Italiano di Unit\\u00e0 Proletaria' (PSIUP).PSU and PSIUP put together Socialists and Catholics who did not accept the main strategy of their respective political families. PSU and PSIUP wanted represent a radically democratic form of modernity, giving great attention to social ferments and to defend all discriminated or under-represented categories: workers, women and young people. PSU and PSIUP were libertarian and they refused the hierarchical structures of a mass party, adopting a fluid organisation totally open to different cultural models.The political relationship between PSU and PSIUP, their ideological exchanges and the contacts between their members have never been explored within a scientific context. The SOCIALCATH project aims to fill this scientific gap, bringing to light many unedited documents. The interdisciplinary approach, the multi-methodological analysis and the comparative nature of the SOCIALCATH project are all new instruments to be used in these arguments.The SOCIALCATH project aims to reach three main objectives:1. to describe the meeting between opposite cultural areas such as Socialism and Catholicism, in order to support the policies for intercultural dialogue promoted by the EU and other international organisations such as UNESCO.2. to highlight alternative aspects of Socialist and Catholic cultures, in order to discover the anti-dogmatic spirit of the 60s and its today's inheritance in the collective European conscience.3. to explore the relationship between the PSU and PSIUP's political class and the new social issues of the 60s (feminism, 'the young' issue, etc.), in order to compare those events with the present attitude of the European leading class towards society and collective issues.'\"],\n [\"EU100062\",\n\"Multi-scale biomechanical modelling and simulation of the intervertebral disc\",\n\"Computational mechanics techniques have revolutionised the design and analysis of engineered structures. The emerging field of Computational Biomechanics (CB) applies these techniques to study biological structures and systems. A key advantage of CB is the ability to predict physical quantities (such as flow and deformation) over a range of length and timescales in biological tissues, whereas such quantities are difficult or impossible to measure experimentally in living organisms.This project will develop multiscale CB approaches to analyse the largest avascular structure in the human body, the intervertebral disc. The intervertebral disc is subjected to large deformations during spinal motion, withstands transient loads of up to 9 times body weight during rigorous physical activity, and due to its lack of blood supply, its nutrient supply is provided by fluid-borne diffusion through the disc tissues from the adjacent vertebral bodies. A multiscale model of the intervertebral disc will substantially advance the study of disc mechanics by linking whole disc loading and deformation to the mechanical microenvironment experienced by cells embedded within the disc tissue. This approach promises new insights into tissue repair and remodelling in healthy discs, into tissue damage and cell death in degenerate discs, and in predicting disc response to emerging treatments such as annular repair and nucleus replacement.\"],\n [\"EU100063\",\n\"STRUCTURE AND DYNAMICS OF PORPHYRIN-BASED MATERIALS IN SOLUTION vs. INTERFACES\",\n\"The goal of the proposed project is to perform a systematic study of the electronic structure and the dynamic behaviour of specifically selected metalloporphyrin materials in solution, and at liquid-solid interfaces, with a time resolution covering the range from sub-femtosecond up to picoseconds which is fundamental for their biochemical properties. Metalloporphyrins play a key role in a wide range of processes, such as the light energy conversion in photosynthesis, or in haem proteins performing the transport of small ligands like oxygen. Because of their peculiar optical, electronic and magnetic properties, they are potential candidates for technological applications like in molecular electronics. It is of fundamental importance to gain a detailed understanding of the structural and dynamic properties of these materials under realistic conditions (i.e. ambient pressure, room temperature, and in heterogeneous environments). Soft X-ray spectroscopy is an ideal tool for this purpose, which has recently been implemented by the PI for the investigation of applied materials in the liquid phase, drawing on international recognition of his achievements. Taking advantage from his broad expertise, the PI extended the soft X-ray spectroscopy to biochemical systems in solutions for the first time. Since last year the PI became the youngest group leader at HZB, and Junior Professor at the Freie Universit\\u00e4t Berlin. Here, the PI proposes to use the laser pump / soft X-ray probe spectroscopy at first in the sub-picosecond domain. The experiments will extended to femtosecond resolution at the X-ray Free Electron Laser facility. To address sub-femtosecond processes, the systematic scanning of the systems with core-clock spectroscopy is intended. The study will provide fundamental knowledge about the electronic structure and dynamics of metalloporphyrin materials which are essential for different applications, thus helping significantly to enhance their performance.'\"],\n [\"EU100064\",\n\"Tailoring Mixed-Metal Chemistry for Frontier Synthetic and Catalytic Applications\",\n\"Designed to meet many of the colossal challenges facing synthetic and organometallic chemists as demanded by current societal, environmental and economic issues, this project will accelerate the development of a  innovative mixed-metal chemistry, which combines two metals with markedly different polarities in the same molecule. Initially polar Mg and non-polar Zn \\u201chybrids\\u201d will be developed followed by other metal pairs. These hybrids will exhibit a unique chemistry distinct to those of their parent monometallic compounds. Building on our recent pioneering work in this area (PNAS 2010, JACS 2010) that uses a tried and tested metal-structural-inorganic approach that allows rationale design of tailor-made mixed-metal reagents, this novel and ambitious research programme will deliver new chemo- and regioselective organobimetallic reagents designed as transformational tools for a broad spectrum of fundamentally important chemical reactions (deprotonation, metal-halogen exchange, alkylation, reduction, electrophilic amination, cross-couplings, etc), used every day in academia and industry. Catalytic, using cheap environmentally benign inorganic salts as catalysts, as well as stoichiometric advances will be made. Mixed-metal reagents will also be pioneered in Green Chemistry, by screening their reactivity using green solvents (e.g., 2-methyltetrahydrofuran) and ultimately, the holy grail, using water, which would inspire a synthetic revolution. Bulky ligand supported mixed-metal reagents will be constructed to activate organic heterocyclic molecules towards novel cascade reactions. Incorporating transition metals and lanthanides to this hybrid methodology will expand even more their opportunities in synthesis towards the development of hybrid catalysts for cross-coupling reactions as an alternative to expensive Pd and Ni methodologies. The award of an ERC Starting Grant will help the PI to consolidate her research team and propel her to an internationally-leading status.\"],\n [\"EU100065\",\n\"Make it simple: towards a new era for organic synthesis\",\n\"Organic synthesis has undeniably made tremendous progress over the past two centuries. Nevertheless, our ability to efficiently synthesise molecules is mostly limited to targets of low structural complexity. Traditional synthetic strategies require the presence of reactive functional groups that are used as handles for further functionalisation. This requirement is one of the factors dramatically enhancing the difficulty of syntheses. The last two decades have seen the emergence of a more straightforward alternative: the direct functionalisation of C-H bonds. Through this strategy the typically inert C-H bonds, ubiquitous in organic molecules, can be activated by transition metal catalysts and subsequently functionalised. This approach has allowed us to dream of a future where any organic molecule could be synthesised in a direct manner by simply replacing the C-H bonds of a substrate with the required functionalities, as if building a ball-and-stick molecular model with our hands. The development of a full set of C-H functionalisation methodologies will impact on all applied areas, such as the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and new materials. Furthermore, their atom efficiency and low waste generation ensures a privileged position among the green chemistry methods.For this strategy to succeed, numerous challenges are still to be overcome. In this research proposal we aim at addressing one of them: the C-H functionalisation of aromatic compounds. We will build up a toolkit of complementary methodologies to functionalise aromatic C-H bonds under mild conditions (energy efficient), with broad functional group tolerance (general), and with absolute control of the regioselectivity. By the end of the five years we aim to have developed a robust general methodology allowing the coupling of any two arenes via double C-H bond activation.\"],\n [\"EU100066\",\n\"Fundamental Physics at the Low Background Frontier\",\n\"The nature of dark matter is one of the fundamental questions in physics today.  Direct signals for dark matter have remained elusive, indicating that multi-tonne scale detectors are needed to measure large numbers of dark matter interactions, while current efforts are at the 100 kg scale.  The foremost challenge is distinguishing dark matter signals from backgrounds, the most uncertain of which are from neutrons.  The research objective of this proposal is a world-leading dark matter search with a novel liquid argon (LAr) detector and a new analysis approach to measuring neutron backgrounds in-situ.The DEAP/CLEAN program of single-phase LAr detectors is a new direction for dark matter searches.  It draws on successful, proven approaches of solar neutrino physics to building low-background detectors that scale simply to multi-tonne target masses.  Demonstration of this approach by the current 100 kg stage (MiniCLEAN) will break new ground for future experiments.  At the 100 tonne scale, such a detector would be a new kind of observatory for fundamental physics at the low background frontier, testing predicted properties of dark matter, neutrinos, supernovae, and stellar evolution.  Success depends critically on demonstrating the required background suppression.This proposal addresses the key challenges of dark matter detection in two new ways, with the novel single-phase effort for multi-tonne scalability, and by developing new methods to overcome neutron backgrounds.  The tasks of this proposal are: (i) to develop a measurement of the in-situ neutron background in LAr; (ii) to develop an active neutron veto for in-situ measurement of the cosmogenic neutron background, beginning with a measurement of the flux and energy spectrum in an existing prototype; and, (iii) to lead the dark matter search, using the measured backgrounds. The MiniCLEAN dark matter sensitivity is a factor of 20 beyond current experimental results, with great potential for discovery.\"],\n [\"EU100067\",\n\"Advanced Immunization Technologies\",\n\"Vaccines so far have been developed mostly by following an empiric approach. To prevent and possibly cure unresolved and emerging infectious diseases we need to fully exploit the potential of the human immune system. Progress in science and technology makes it possible to achieve what was previously deemed impossible. The scope of this project is to produce knowledge necessary to develop novel and powerful immunization technologies for the next generation of human vaccines. This goal requires a multidisciplinary approach in which diverse but complementary scientific disciplines and technologies converge. Therefore some of the most competitive European research groups from public institutions and biotechs have agreed to join forces in ADITEC, together with top US groups on systems biology and adjuvants to support this enterprise.A systems biology approach will be used to study licensed and experimental vaccines in patient characterization studies and in clinical trials, to investigate the effect of adjuvants, vectors, formulations, delivery devices, routes of immunization, homologous and heterologous prime\\u2013boost schedules, as well as the impact of host factors such as age, gender, genetics and pathologies. Animal models will be used to complement human studies, and to select novel immunization technologies to be advanced to the clinic.To address these issues in a coordinated manner, ADITEC is organised on a matrix structure in which research themes and experimental approaches feed into each other. Training curricula will be created to impact on the formation of the next generation of EU researchers in the field. ADITEC scientists and institutions are part of  the \\u201cSclavo Vaccines Association\\u201d (SVA), which is dedicated to vaccines and vaccine research.

The NCLs are neurodegenerative diseases characterized by dementia, blindness, epilepsy and physical decline leading to an early death of the patients. Since no cure is currently available, these disorders represent a serious social, medical, and economic challenge.To date, eight NCL genes have been characterised. There is evidence suggesting that further gene loci remain to be identified. NCLs are under-diagnosed in many countries around the world as there is an overall lack of research, early diagnosis, treatment and expert availability. Furthermore, due to their broad genetic heterogeneity it is difficult to collect large numbers of genetically similar patients. As such, large therapeutic studies required for advances in treatment are difficult to initiate. The DEM-CHILD project will combine the expertise of (i) recognized European research teams with (ii) high-technology SMEs, and will (iii) collaborate with Indian experts on the following objectives:(1) High-technology SMEs will develop innovative cost- and time-effective testing and screening methods for all NCLs in order to ensure early diagnosis and thereby prevention.(2) DEM-CHILD will collect the world\\u2019s largest, clinically and genetically best characterised set of NCL patients in order to study disease prevalence and precisely describe the natural history of the NCLs leading to the development of an evaluation tool for experimental therapy studies.(3) Novel biomarkers and modifiers of NCL will be identified to support the development of innovative therapies.(4) Focussing on the development of therapies for NCLs caused by mutations in intracellular transmembrane proteins, two complementary therapeutic strategies will be used and compared in eye and brain of mouse models: a) viral-mediated gene transfer and b) neural stem cell-mediated delivery of neuroprotective factors.'\"],\n [\"EU100069\",\n\"Resistance in Gram-Negative Organisms: Studying Intervention Strategies\",\n\"Antibiotics are a mainstay of public health, but their use has increased exponentially leading to the emergence of antibiotic resistance.

An interesting technique or avoiding this bottleneck is the implementation of wireless intra- and inter-chip interconnects. An efficient wireless link between two or more integrated circuits requires the integration of the transceiver circuitry, as well as the antennas. The latest CMOS technology generations support integration of high-frequency circuitry well into the millimetre-wave range. An area-efficient way to integrate the antennas is to share chip area between the integrated circuit and the antenna. This is achieved by cutting the circuitry ground supply plane into patches and using these patches as antenna electrodes. Here it is assumed that the circuit ground plane is manufactured in the top metallisation layer of the CMOS process.The goal of the project is to investigate the monolithic integrated antennas using the CMOS circuit ground plane as antenna electrodes. The antenna input impedance will be evaluated numerically and experimentally for various antenna geometries. The influence of the substrate and the chip dicing in the antenna radiation parameters will be studied. The interference between the integrated CMOS digital circuits and the wireless chip-to-chip link will be estimated. These studies will give sound theoretical basis for the implementation of wireless chip-to-chip interconnects.The project will be an important step in the career development of the applicant. He will be joining a leading research institution, where he will be managing his own projects and will be involved in teaching activities. The applicant is moving from Germany - a country with sound reputation in science and research, to his home country of Bulgaria.

It is, however, not clear whether the increased health risks are due to lack of moderate to vigorous activity or due to a more sedentary lifestyle. Sedentary behaviour cannot simply be defined as the lack of moderate to vigorous activity but is defined as engaging in activities which marginally increase energy expenditure above resting level such as sitting, using the computer, and watching television. Understanding the health consequences of sedentary behaviour independently and jointly associated with physical activity is essential in order to promote healthy behaviours and more effective guidelines.In the present proposal we aim to disentangle the relation between objectively measured sedentary behaviour and physical activity in relation to type 2 diabetes and diabetic complications in the Maastricht Study in the Netherlands. The Maastricht Study is a large newly established cohort study focusing on the determinants and consequences of type 2 diabetes. Using the innovative activPAL\\u2122 accelerometer we will be able to examine daily activity across the full range of activity intensities. The objectives of the current proposal are:1) to describe and compare patterns of daily activity among people with diabetes, prediabetes and those without type 2 diabetes;2) to examine the association between sedentary behaviour and prevalent and incident (pre)diabetes and to understand whether this is independent of physical activity; and3) to examine the relation between sedentary behaviour and prevalent and incident diabetic complications and to understand whether this is independent of physical activity.This research will both advance the physical activity research field and the diabetes field. The discoveries of the project are expected to have important public health impact and can affect both physical activity guidelines and guidelines to prevent/delay type 2 diabetes and its complications.\"],\n [\"EU100073\",\n\"Embodied Cognitive Models for Fluent Human-Robot Interaction\",\n\"Robotics is moving from industrial applications into personal and office environments, in part due to converging trends of an aging population, a shrinking workforce, and a decrease in production costs. The research field of Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) studies the models and algorithms necessary for robots to interact with non-professional humans in these new environments.However, most HRI models are structured in a discrete turn-taking framework, based on dialog, planning, and state-action models. This usually results in a rigid and delayed stop-and-go interaction, which is unlike the simultaneous, fluent action coordination humans are used to from each other.This research proposes to bridge this gap by evaluating new computational models enabling fluent coordination in human-robot interaction. The goal is to design robots that interact with untrained humans in a more natural and human-acceptable way, facilitating their integration into homes, offices, hospitals, and workshops.The research proposed is based on recent cognitive and neurological research in embodied cognition, which sheds new light on the how humans coordinate their actions in a fluent manner. It proposes to computationally model these findings - in particular those of perceptual emulators and real-time action predictors -  and to implement them in a human-robot collaborative setting. It also proposes to conduct human-subject studies evaluating the benefits of these new models, and their acceptance by untrained users.The project's potential is to suggest new research paths in HRI, extend the current knowledge in embodied cognition, and produce practical outcomes for the design of robotic systems for the general population. Due to the recent return of the applicant to the EU zone from the US, this proposal is also crucial for the reintegration of the applicant into the EU zone, as well as for the successful transfer of knowledge and future collaboration with top US research institutes.\"],\n [\"EU100074\",\n\"Heuristics and Biases in Debt Managment\",\n\"Managing a debt portfolio requires complex decision making and is particularly challenging in the current climate of economic instability. Faced with various debts and diverse interest rates, consumers must decide the amount to allocate and the order in which to settle their debts. Issues of debt management also impact financial institutions such as banks and credit companies who need to understand how their borrowers prioritize their payments to be able to estimate the probability that their loans will be paid back. This research program aims to identify heuristics and biases that affect consumers when managing their debts. We examine when debt behaviors are aligned with normative strategies and when they lead people to make predictable but irrational decisions. Using versions of interactive debt management games as well as other experimental methods the program is designed to achieve three main goals: (1) identify sources of suboptimal debt management (Studies 1-2) (2) expand our understanding of the processes underlying debt management decisions (Studies 3-4), and (3) explore techniques to direct consumers toward more optimal debt management strategies (Studies 5-6). Along with its theoretical contribution, the proposed research program has important practical implications. Understanding how people perceive and manage their debts will allow financial organizations to create tools and procedures to assist their clients in managing their loans, and improving the rationality of their debt repayments.\"],\n [\"EU100075\",\n\"Neural Circuits Underlying Visually Guided Behaviour\",\n\"A fundamental goal of neuroscience is to understand how information processing in neural circuits gives rise to behavior.   Even the simplest actions can involve hundreds of neurons distributed throughout the brain.  However, for most behaviors, little is known about which neurons play an important role, how they are organized into circuits, or how activity is transformed between different brain areas. The zebrafish model provides a unique opportunity to thoroughly dissect the neural basis of behavior in a vertebrate, due to their small, transparent brains, robust visual responses, and amenability to genetic manipulation. Using two-photon imaging, we can scan the entire area of the brain while monitoring the activity of individual neurons. This research programme aims to dissect the circuits underlying simple visually guided behaviors in larval zebrafish using a combination of state-of-the-art imaging, genetics and behavioral analysis. We propose to 1) perform a quantitative analysis of zebrafish behavior using high speed videography, and a custom designed arena for presentation of visual stimuli to freely swimming fish, 2) identify individual neurons and circuits that are active during these behaviors using two-photon imaging of fish expressing genetically encoded calcium indicators to and 3) perturb activity in these circuits using targeted single cell laser ablations and optogenetics.  These experiments will map out the functional architecture of the zebrafish brain, revealing sets of neurons that comprise complete behavioral circuits in a vertebrate. Furthermore, they will provide an essential framework for the analysis of neural development, genetic mutants and disease models.\"],\n [\"EU100076\",\n\"Mont-Blanc, European scalable and power efficient HPC platform based on low-power embedded technology\",\n\"There is a continued need for higher compute performance: scientific grand challenges, engineering, geophysics, bioinformatics, etc. However, energy is increasingly becoming one of the most expensive resources and the dominant cost item for running a large supercomputing facility. In fact the total energy cost of a few years of operation can almost equal the cost of the hardware infrastructure. Energy efficiency is already a primary concern for the design of any computer system and it is unanimously recognized that Exascale systems will be strongly constrained by power.<br/>The analysis of the performance of HPC systems since 1993 shows exponential improvements at the rate of one order of magnitude every 3 years: One petaflops was achieved in 2008, one exaflops is expected in 2020. Based on a 20 MW power budget, this requires an efficiency of 50 GFLOPS/Watt. However, the current leader in energy efficiency achieves only 1.7 GFLOPS / Watt. Thus, a 30x improvement is required.<br/>In this project, we believe that HPC systems developed from today's energy-efficient solutions used in embedded and mobile devices are the most likely to succeed. As of today, the CPUs of these devices are mostly designed by ARM. However, ARM processors have not been designed for HPC, and ARM chips have never been used in HPC systems before, leading to a number of significant challenges.<br/>The Mont-Blanc project has three objectives:- To develop a fully functional energy-efficient HPC prototype using low-power commercially available embedded technology- To design a next-generation HPC system together with a range of embedded technologies in order to overcome the limitations identified in the prototype system- To develop a portfolio of exascale applications to be run on this new generation of HPC systems.<br/>This will produce a new type of computer architecture capable of setting future global HPC standards that will provide Exascale performance using 15 to 30 times less energy.\"],\n [\"EU100077\",\n\"Collaborative Research into Exascale Systemware, Tools and Applications\",\n\"For the past thirty years, the need for ever greater supercomputer performance has driven the development of many computing technologies which have subsequently been exploited in the mass market. Delivering an exaflop (or 10^18 calculations per second) by the end of this decade is the challenge that the supercomputing community worldwide has set itself. The Collaborative Research into Exascale Systemware, Tools and Applications project (CRESTA) brings together four of Europe's leading supercomputing centres, with one of the world's major equipment vendors, two of Europe's leading programming tools providers and six application and problem owners to explore how the exaflop challenge can be met. CRESTA focuses on the use of six applications with exascale potential and uses them as co-design vehicles to develop: the development environment, algorithms and libraries, user tools, and the underpinning and cross-cutting technologies required to support the execution of applications at the exascale. The applications represented in CRESTA have been chosen as a representative sample from across the supercomputing domain including: biomolecular systems, fusion energy, the virtual physiological human, numerical weather prediction and engineering.<br/>No one organisation, be they a hardware or software vendor or service provider can deliver the necessary range of technological innovations required to enable computing at the exascale. This is recognised through the on-going work of the International Exascale Software Project and, in Europe, the European Exascale Software Initiative. CRESTA will actively engage with European and International collaborative activities to ensure that Europe plays its full role worldwide. Over its 39 month duration the project will deliver key, exploitable technologies that will allow the co-design applications to successfully execute on multi-petaflop systems in preparation for the first exascale systems towards the end of this decade.\"],\n [\"EU100078\",\n\"Virtual Enterprises by Networked Interoperability Services\",\n\"Enterprise interoperability is the emerging need in Europe for joint projects and business facing new marketing challenges.In multi-partner projects and business, aimed at developing innovative joint products, Large Enterprises suffer from a lack of synergy and cohesion with Medium-Small-Micro Enterprises due to the missing sharing of project information, flow of knowledge, synergy of workflows, etc. A novel level of integration is expected, while guaranteeing the security on proprietary information and preserving the already existing company management processes, fixed in years of past activity.The VENIS project is aimed at bridging the gap of interoperability between Large and Medium-Small-Micro Enterprises, according to the 'Virtual Organisation' paradigm:-\\\\ta distributed and secure repository to share the information contained in the file systems, databases, ERPs, CRMs, and other legacy applications of the enterprises, connecting the IT Infrastructures from Large to Micro enterprises;-\\\\ta set of lightweight web services for the smart integration of the information exchanged in joint works, based on legacy email systems and boosted by semantic annotations and search;-\\\\ta distributed processes engine mechanism, able to link and execute the enterprises business processes, to assist the work in joint businesses and to create novel synergies in products supply chains.Latest documents and multimedia, meeting planning, joint work flow and milestones, etc. will be then easily available to all the persons involved both from Large to Micro enterprises, while leaving almost unchanged the already existing legacy procedures.The Consortium, composed by 7 Partners skilled in international collaboration, is well balanced in expertise between technology developers and final users. The VENIS results will be disseminated on the Web and in International Conferences, thanks to the creation of a VENIS Community of users,Boosted by VENIS, the involved Enterprises expect to improve their competitive edge in joint projects, by exploiting the project results in their joint business and towards external market, bringing an estimated 15-20% increase of business during the 3 years following the end of the project.\"],\n [\"EU100079\",\n\"2nd-Generation Open Access Infrastructure for Research in Europe\",\n\"OpenAIREplus will build a 2nd-Generation Open Access Infrastructure by significantly expanding in several directions the outcomes of the OpenAIRE project, which implements the EC Open Access (OA) pilot. Capitalizing on the OpenAIRE infrastructure, built for managing FP7 and ERC funded articles, and the associated supporting mechanism of the European Helpdesk System, OpenAIREplus will 'develop an open access, participatory infrastructure for scientific information'. It will significantly expand its base of harvested publications to also include all OA publications indexed by the DRIVER infrastructure (more than 270 validated institutional repositories) and any other repository containing 'peer-reviewed literature' that complies with certain standards. It will also generically harvest and index the metadata of scientific datasets in selected diverse OA thematic data repositories. It will support the concept of linked publications by deploying novel services for 'linking peer-reviewed literature and associated data sets and collections', from link discovery based on diverse forms of mining (textual, usage, etc.), to storage, visual representation, and on-line exploration. It will offer both user-level services to experts and 'non-scientists' alike as well as programming interfaces for 'providers of value-added services' to build applications on its content. Deposited articles and data will be openly accessible through an enhanced version of the OpenAIRE portal, together with any available relevant information on associated project funding and usage statistics. OpenAIREplus will retain its European footprint, engaging people and scientific repositories in almost all 27 EU member states and beyond. The technical work will be complemented by a suite of studies and associated research efforts that will partly proceed in collaboration with 'different European initiatives' and investigate issues of 'intellectual property rights, efficient financing models, and standards'.\"],\n [\"EU100080\",\n\"Manufacturing SErvice Ecosystem\",\n\"VISION: 'By 2015, novel service-oriented management methodologies and the Future Internet universal business infrastructure will enable European virtual factories and  enterprises to self-organize in distributed, autonomous, interoperable, non-hierarchical innovation ecosystems of tangible and intangible manufacturing assets, to be virtually described, on-the-fly composed and dynamically delivered as a Service, end-to-end along the globalised value chain.'The first Grand Challenge for MSEE project is to make SSME (Service Science Management and Engineering) evolve towards Manufacturing Systems and Factories of the Future, i.e. from a methodological viewpoint to adapt, modify, extend SSME concepts so that they could be applicable to traditionally product-oriented enterprises; from an implementation viewpoint to instantiate Future Internet service oriented architectures and platforms for global manufacturing service systems.The second Grand Challenge for MSEE project is to transform current manufacturing hierarchical supply chains into manufacturing open ecosystems, i.e. on the one side to define and implement business processes and policies to support collaborative innovation in a secure industrial environment; on the other side to define a new collaborative architecture for ESA (Enterprise Software and Applications), to support business-IT interaction and distributed decision making in virtual factories and enterprises.The synthesis of the two Grand Challenges above in industrial business scenarios and their full adoption in some European test cases will result in new Virtual Factory Industrial Models, where service orientation and collaborative innovation will support a new renaissance of Europe in the global manufacturing context.\"],\n [\"EU100081\",\n\"Comprehensive European Approach to the Protection of Civil Aviation\",\n\"Security has become a major factor in civil/commercial aviation. In recent decades, the number of threats to aviation security has grown significantly, especially after 9/11. This has led to ever more security regulations as the threats evolve. Security procedures have become exceedingly complex and invasive to passenger privacy; the number of security measures as well as personnel and therefore costs are growing steadily.At the same time passenger and cargo traffic are expected to double in the next 15 years. Already today, security is one of the main reasons for delayed take-off. It is clear that the current complex security system cannot be adapted to such a growth without a large rise in costs. It has already and will increasingly become a major market restraint.Therefore, the proposed project COPRA aims to answer two questions:\\u2022 How does the threat situation in civil aviation evolve in the future, taking into account both existing and new technologies and their continuing development and proliferation?\\u2022 Which opportunities arise from the development and proliferation of new technologies and security procedures to overcome the current complex and expensive security situation and to enable sustainable growth for the future?COPRA\\u2019s main objective is to answer both questions in a way that will constitute the optimal balance between security, privacy, public acceptability, mobility and costs, while providing ideas on how to increase flexibility and resilience of the whole aviation system against threats.To that aim COPRA brings together a well balanced consortium of research organisations, industry and major air transport providers with a wide range of European stakeholders. End-users, technology providers, policy makers and think tanks will be involved in COPRA through the formation of expert groups. The involvement of these expert groups is essential to the success of COPRA\\u2019s objectives.\"],\n [\"EU100082\",\n\"Development of Rad Hard non volatile Flash memories for space applications\",\n\"The project aims to realise a strong methodology for the development and design of non volatile memories usign standard CMOS silicon process actually used for consumer electronics. Since standard silicon memories, such as other silicon devices for consumer market, fails under irradiation two different approaches are envisaged: the first one is to develop specific technological processes able to substain heavy ions and other charged particles while the second one is more devoted to use specific design and architectures.The first approach, also known as Radiation Hardening by Process (RHBP), is very expensive and tied to technological issues which can be faced only by large corporates and, due to the very low amount of final devices to be realised, very difficult to follow (great deal of effort for a small niche market).The second approach, also known as Radiation Hardening by Design (RHBD), takes the best from standard CMOS consumer processes and, using very accurate design methodologies, mitigates radiation effects on silicon processes.Semiconductor memories, among rad hard integrated circuit scenario, are one of the most critical topic and non volatile memories in particular.Actually both volatile and non volatile memories, excluding few excpetions, are integrated using standard processes and standard architectures. This means that the final device is typically at least Rad Tolerant and not Rad Hard and failure during mission is avoided using Error Correctin Code techniques including redundancy (more devices of the same type are used in voting manner) at board level.The basic goal of the project is to give a methodology for the development of a generic rad hard non volatile memory with the features actually used in consumer market (good retention, reprogrammability and cyclicity) and realise a prototype (1Mbit Flash Memory) in order to validate the approach.\"],\n [\"EU100083\",\n\"Supporting decentralised management to improve health workforce performance in Ghana, Uganda and Tanzania\",\n\"The proposal addresses the workforce deficit in sub-Saharan countries in Africa by improving the overall performance of the workforce.  Management strengthening activities will be tested to identify what improvements can be made within available resources in decentralised management structures.  The management strengthening activities will develop integrated approaches to improving workforce performance based on a situation analysis and monitor the impact on workforce performance and on unintended systems effects.  New knowledge will be developed on the effectiveness of an action-based approach to management strengthening and what strategies improve health workforce performance in different contexts.\"],\n [\"EU100084\",\n\"WORDS: Asymmetry, change and processing in phonological mental representation\",\n\"In the most general terms, the novel objective of the proposed project is to investigate the abstract nature of the mental phonological representations of words which is claimed to govern the (i) time-course of on-line word-recognition and (ii) the temporal dimension of historical development.The project will pursue four research questions, where the answers to each call for a dialogue between a variety of disciplines:A. WHAT is the nature and phonological structure of mental representations of WORDS and HOW are they constrained?B. HOW are these representations processed and accessed in the course of everyday communication?C. HOW and WHY do representations change, while sometimes tenaciously remaining constant over time?D. CAN the hypotheses and predictions about mental representations be computationally modelled?The PI complements her strong linguistics research profile with her forte in psycholinguistics and neurolinguistics. The hypothesis we will test is that the abstract representation of words in the adult brain, which handles asymmetric phonological variation in speech and is measurable by reaction time and brain-imaging techniques, is also reflected in the development of words as indicated by historical data from manuscripts.\"],\n [\"EU100085\",\n\"Thyroid hormone and development of cardiomyocytes derived from human embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells\",\n\"Human embryonic stem cells, and embryonic-like induced pluripotent stem cells made from adult human skin, can differentiate to form beating cardiac muscle cells (cardiomyocytes).  These stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes (SC-CM) are being investigated for use in cardiac repair, but also as a model system for research or drug toxicology. Their human origin, stability in culture and ability to be easily genetically modified in culture makes them far superior to present sources.  Immediately after differentiation, SC-CM have the characteristics of immature foetal or neonatal cells in terms of contraction, growth and intracellular signalling. To realize their full potential, they need to grow towards the adult cardiomyocyte in these respects. We have evidence that this occurs in culture, over time-frames of 3-6 months, and that reproducing the stimuli for maturation can produce or accelerate these changes.  One key maturational stimulus is thyroid hormone, and the first part of the project will apply this to SC-CM. However, the foetus has evolved sophisticated mechanisms to protect itself from maternal thyroid hormone, to prevent premature development.  Intrinsic enzyme systems and receptor expression levels carefully control the intracellular environment with respect to levels of T3, the active agent, to preserve the natural staged differentiation and maturation programme.  Particularly, an enzyme called D3 keeps levels of T3 tonically low.  In the second time we will investigate the synergistic effects of adding T3 and down-regulating D3 on the rate and extent of maturation of the SC-CM.  In the adult, cardiac growth programmes in response to increased load (hypertension for example) have been classified as pathological, while that controlled by thyroid hormone has been defined as physiological.  In the third time we will compare the characteristics of SC-CM after T3-induced growth with our previous findings on stretch- or catecholamine-induced growth.\"],\n [\"EU100086\",\n\"Predicting Properties of Large Heterogeneous Systems with Optimally-Tuned Range-Separated Hybrid Functionals\",\n\"I propose to develop a broadly applicable, quantitatively reliable, computationally simple approach to the study of large heterogeneous systems, and to apply it to important problems in molecular and organic electronics and photovoltaics. This will be based on a radically different approach to the development and application of density functional theory (DFT) - determining an optimally yet non-empirically tuned system-specific functional, instead of seeking a universally applicable one.Large heterogeneous systems are vital to several of the most burning challenges facing materials science. Perhaps most notably, this includes materials systems relevant for basic energy sciences, e.g., for photovoltaics or photocatalysis, but also includes, e.g., organic/inorganic interfaces that are crucial for molecular, organic, and hybrid organic/inorganic (opto)electronic systems. Theory and modelling of such systems face many challenges and would benefit greatly from accurate first principles calculations. However, the \\u201cwork-horse\\u201d of such large-scale calculations \\u2013 DFT \\u2013 faces multiple, serious challenges when applied to such systems. This includes treating systems with components of different chemical nature, predicting energy level alignment, predicting charge transfer, handling weak interactions, and more. Solving all these problems within conventional DFT is extremely difficult, and even if at all possible the result will likely be too computationally complex for many applications.Instead, I propose a completely different strategy - sacrifice the quest for an all-purpose functional and focus on per-system physical criteria that can fix system-specific parameters without recourse to empiricism. The additional flexibility would help us gain tremendously in simplicity and applicability without loss of predictive power. I propose a practical scheme based on tunable range-separated hybrid functionals and a plan for its application to a wide range of practical systems.\"],\n [\"EU100087\",\n\"REsearch into POlicy to enhance Physical Activity\",\n\"In line with the Call\\u2019s overall objective, the basic concept of the proposal is to integrate scientific research knowledge (=evidence), expert know-how and the real world policy making processes to increase synergy and sustainability in promoting health and preventing disease among Europeans. The REsearch into POlicy in Physical Activity (REPOPA) consortium will take up this challenge and will bring together scientific researchers from different disciplines and expertise, policy makers as well as stakeholders, including citizens, whom the policies concern. The five project years will be used to build on evidence and experiences, study innovative \\u2018win-win\\u2019 ways to collaborate between academia and policy makers, and establish structures and best practices for future European health promotion. The objectives are: 1) to assess needs, role and use of research evidence in policy making (WP1); 2) to study ways research evidence is combined and negotiated with \\u2018other kind of evidence\\u2019 in cross-sector policy making process with the focus on physical activity policies (WP1, WP2, WP3); 3) via two interventions to explore innovative ways to translate research evidence into policy making process (WP2 & WP3); 4) to further translate the results into guidance and tools for the future enhancement of evidence-informed policy making in Europe (WP4); 5) to disseminate the results and lessons learned widely and to build structures to enhance sustainability in evidence-informed policy making (WP6); and 6) to evaluate the results and processes as well as impact of the REPOPA (WP5). REPOPA consortium brings in scientific excellence in health research, including physical activity and links it with real life experience in policy making and expertise in knowledge translation from different regions and in six countries in Europe and in Canada. Overall, REPOPA is in line with the concept of Health in All Policies.\"],\n [\"EU100088\",\n\"Evolution and Transfer of Antibiotic Resistance\",\n\"Antibiotics are essential therapeutics in the treatment of bacterial infections. However, the indiscriminate use of antibiotics has led to the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria that pose a major threat to human health as options for treating infections by these bacteria have become limited. The evolution, emergence and spread ofantibiotic resistance genes are still only poorly understood and expanding our knowledge on these aspects will provide novel leads to combat the emergence of antibiotic resistance.The EvoTAR consortium gathers a multi-disciplinary group of leading European researchers in the fields of antibiotic resistance, microbial genomics and mathematical modelling. In addition, three research-intensive SMEs participate in EvoTAR, two of which are involved in the development of novel approaches to minimize the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance.The purpose of EvoTAR is to increase the understanding of the evolution and spread of antibiotic resistance in human pathogens. EvoTAR will characterise the human reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes (\\u201cthe resistome\\u201d) by investigating the dynamics and evolution of the interaction between resistant and non-resistant bacteria fromthe human microbiome and the interrelations of the human resistome with non-human reservoirs of resistance genes. Novel methods will be used to quantify resistance transfer under controlled conditions in gene exchange communities. Mathematical modelling will be applied to predict gene flow between different reservoirs and topredict future resistance trends. Novel in vitro and in vivo models will allow the study of the efficacy of novel therapeutics aimed at reducing selection and spread of antibiotic resistance.The EvoTAR project will generate novel insights into the evolution and spread of antibiotic resistance genes and thereby create opportunities for the development of novel interventions to curb the rising tide of antibiotic resistance in human pathogens.\"],\n [\"EU100089\",\n\"The 2050+ Airport\",\n\"This project will explore new airport concepts with radical and novel solutions to prepare airports for 2050 and beyond. It will build on the High Level Target Concepts (HLTC) from the Advisory Council for Aeronautics Research in Europe (ACARE) Strategic Research Agenda (SRA) 2. The SRA-2 underlines the importance of the air transport sector with respect to value added, Gross Domestic Product, jobs and people mobility. The airport plays a vital role in the Air Transport System (ATS).The future airport will have to meet different objectives amongst other in the area of environment, costs and performance. Each airport is likely to have a focus on one of these areas that can vary between different airports. Therefore, the \\u201c2050\\\\ Airport\\u201d project develops three different airport concepts (passenger time efficient, climate neutral and low cost) that demonstrate what the future airport will look like when taking one of the areas as the leading objective. The project shows the benefits and challenges of the different concepts and the trade-offs between the different areas to be made. The airport concepts describe the interface between the aircraft and the ground and the new principles for the airport layout including intermodal connections. The passenger and the baggage will experience a seamless travel through the 2050\\\\ airport.The approach is to develop concrete concepts taking into account input from existing studies like the \\u201cout of the box\\u201d project and input from other stakeholders like universities, research institutes, airports and industry.

Legiotex Demo is based on the results of the Legiotex proposal. The general objective of the project was the development of a water filter (LegioTex\\u00aeWATER) capable to inhibit the growth and proliferation of the bacteria belonging to the Legionella Pneumophila family in water-based climate control equipment and sanitary water distribution systems in risk of becoming a source for legionnaire's disease outbreaks in large public and industrial facilities. For developing the aimed filter, environmental-friendly bactericides were appropriately fixed onto nonwoven textiles, assuring a long lasting biocide effect and optimum mechanical properties. The filter was mounted onto a disposal cartridge for its quick replacement, and this within a metal housing to be easily installed in different equipments, to have an optimum fluid-dynamic behaviour and successful commercialization. The aim of LEGIOTEX-DEMO is to install the product prototype for the prevention of Legionella contamination in a demonstration installation of a representative facility in risk of becoming a source of legionnaire\\u00b4s disease (a potentially fatal pneumonia-like infection) to corroborate the efficacy of the developed prototype.\"],\n [\"EU100091\",\n\"Fruitful Instability: The Cultural Logic of Creative Practice in Israeli High-Technology Start-Ups\",\n\"Israel, a country of only 7.7 million people, has the highest density of start-ups in the world (1 for every 1844 Israelis). Furthermore, more Israeli companies are listed on the NASDAQ exchange than all companies from the entire European continent. In addition, in 2008, per capita venture capital investments in Israel were 2.5 times greater than in the U.S., and more than 30 times greater than in Europe. This productivity takes place in one of the most unstable geopolitical regions in the world. This is a paradox given the fact that organizational theory and common sense suggest the importance of a stable geopolitical environment for successful market and business functionality, especially in the start-up industry that is by itself characterized by high levels of financial risk.This research will rely on ethnographic fieldwork and participant observation in two Israeli high-technology start-ups and the Israeli start-up sector in order to account for the cultural logic that explains this paradox. The research hypothesis is that Israel\\u2019s unstable geopolitical reality has a number of productive features that are commensurate with some of the specific features of successful start-ups. I will study this productive relationship at three different levels: 1) the commensurability between the cognitive and procedural orientations former Israeli Defense Forces-trained high-tech people acquire during their military service and the cognitive and procedural orientations mobilized in much of the research and development in successful Israeli start-ups; 2) culturally-specific interactional norms among Israeli start-up employees that are the product of Israel\\u2019s conflictual history and that are conducive to flexible organizational decision-making; and 3) the commensurability between the risk-intensive Israeli culture and the cultural framework needed for the risk-intensive transformation of innovative ideas into marketable products through the recruitment of venture capital.\"],\n [\"EU100092\",\n\"Nanoparticle - Cell Interactions, a Pathway for Understanding Nanotoxicity:  from a Model System to in-vitro System\",\n\"While nanotechnology-based products and nanoparticle mediated solution for a wide range of applications are constantly surface the market, there is increased interest and concern, around the benefits and risks of this technology. As nanoparticles size crosses the barrier of 100 nm, many of the traditional laws break down and other effects and properties start dominating (quantum size effects, extremely high surface energy etc). This raises questions regarding the suitability of traditional methods, such as in-vitro test kits and in-vivo animal models used to evaluate their potential toxicity. It is therefore essential to understand the cell - nanoparticle interaction at a fundamental molecular level in complex or simplified biological environments in order to asses their potential toxicity. Further on this foundation the modulation of the nanoparticle properties will allow for optimal performance in drug delivery, bioimaging, medical device coatings, bio-sensors, biochip development, biofouling protection and mitigate nanotoxicology.The major aim of this research endeavor is to study and understand the interactions that take place at the nano-bio interface, as a function of the particle size and the proteins from the biological environment that have been adsorbed on the surface of the particle. To achieve that we propose the utilization of two state of the art surface sensitive techniques; ie the Atomic Force Microscope and the Acoustic Biosensors, that will be used either separately or in combination for the study of the the interaction force and the structural changes that occur. Initially these interactions will be studied on a simplified membrane model, to avoid complex interactions, a supported lipid bilayer, in order to understand the foundation of these interactions, and later transition to an in-vitro model, an actual cell, to study the interaction in a natural, more realistic environment.\"],\n [\"EU100093\",\n\"Protecting biodiversity in the face of climate change\",\n\"Human-induced land use changes are causing extensive habitat fragmentation. As a result, many species are not able to shift their ranges in response to climate change, and will need to adapt to changing conditions. A prudent strategy to maximize the evolutionary potential of populations is to focus conservation efforts on areas where levels of intraspecific variation are high. Recently, I proposed a novel approach to integrate evolutionary processes with traditional prioritization strategies, using spatially explicit models of intraspecific genetic and phenotypic variation. The next crucial step in the further development and refinement of the framework is to understand its general utility. The objectives of this project are to: 1) measure morphological characteristics and genotype 10 common species each in Bulgaria/Romania and Cameroon; 2) map the spatial patterns of intraspecific variation in these regions; 3) prioritize areas for conservation based on intraspecific variation versus species richness; 4) measure the effectiveness of intraspecific variation in one species as a surrogate; 5) compare the overlap in reserves based on either intraspecific variation or species richness; 6) compare the utility of coding versus non-coding genetic markers. The deliverables will be: 1) maps identifying areas with high amounts of intraspecific variation, 2) insight into the general applicability of our approach, 3) a better understanding of the relationship between biotic and abiotic diversity, 4) insight into the effects of neutral and selective processes on population divergence, 5) further understanding of how environmental variation shapes divergence in neutral and adaptive loci, 6) a toolbox of methods for use by conservation planners. This project will greatly enhance the implementation in conservation prioritization of the framework developed, as well as our ability to make recommendations on its usage.\"],\n [\"EU100094\",\n\"NUCLEOLAR-DEPENDENT SECRETION OF MICRORNA IN A MODEL OF DOXORUBICIN AND TRASTUZUMAB CARDIOMYOPATHY\",\n\"Combination of Doxorubicin (Dox) and the monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Trz) is being effectively used against breast cancer, but associated with high incidence of cardiotoxicity. The mechanisms of Dox\\\\Trz induced synergic cardiotoxicity are still unclear. Recently the activation of the microRNA 146a has been shown to have a role in the synergistic effect of Dox and Trz cardiotoxicity. MicroRNAs (miRNA) are ~22 nucleotides long non-coding RNAs regulating complex cellular processes. MiRNAs can be detected in the systemic circulation and their levels increase under various stress conditions. Growing body of evidence suggests that circulating miRNAs are actively released and may act as signaling molecules on close or even distant target cells. Mechanism of miRNA secretion is not completely characterized Recent literature suggests a intriguing idea that the nucleolus may play a critical role during miRNA release and reuptake . The short term goal of this proposal is to identify a diagnostic signature of circulating miRNA in response to Dox\\\\Trz treatment. The long term goal is to study the mechanisms of release and reuptake of miRNAs and demonstrate the role of the nucleolus in these processes. Specific tasks will focus on: 1) Analysis of circulating miRNAs from plasma of mice treated with Saline, Dox or Dox\\\\Trz. 2) Identification of secreted miRNAs in response to Dox, Trz , and Dox\\\\Trz in adult human cardiac stromal cells (hCStCs) and cardiac progenitor cells (hCPCs). 3) Study the mechanism/s of release and uptake of miRNAs upon stress. 4) Role of the nucleolar protein nucleophosmin (NPM) on miRNAs export and uptake upon stress. Significance is the delineation of new mechanisms controlling myocardial stress response and identification of molecular interventional targets that mitigate drug-mediated cardiotoxicity and improve myocardial survival.\"],\n [\"EU100095\",\n\"Technology & Design Kits for Printed-Electronics\",\n\"The goal of Technology & Design Kit for Printed Electronics (TDK4PE) is to set a fundamental change in the way printed electronics (PE) are designed and manufactured in Europe, with the aim of reducing costs and time-to-market by more than an order of magnitude for more complex designs than ever before by addressing thousands of transistors on a substrate.The key is to develop a methodology to enable application-specific PE circuit implementation. This will be achieved by adopting a methodology similar to the silicon microelectronics one: using a Technology and Design Kit to abstract physics to a point where engineers could address physical design with sufficient certainty and great freedom for creativity. This TDK will support circuit design at physical, full-custom, and cell-based levels.TDK4PE addresses the whole product and value chain from concept application to material, through design to manufacturing using both S2S and R2R processes. It will establish cell-based design methodologies coupled with technology process flows and supported by Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools towards mass production. EDA needs building cell libraries based on characterized devices made of functional inks and will enable automatic synthesis of circuits with predictable properties, high yield and improved circuit reliability.Establishing such a methodology is an ambitious task that can only be approached from a consortium possessing a wide range of complementary skills. TDK4PE has brought together such a collaboration of European key players in the fields of materials, inks, printing technologies, manufacturing, modelling, component and system design, microelectronics, EDA tools and applications.Two key points are at the technological opposite poles of this project -FOLAE technology and applications- that shall come together on a seamless way by means of a TDK and its related methodology, which will be the enablers for PE design activities between both of them. This convergence between PE technology and its potential applications will contribute to create a sustainable business sector with potential for significant future growth.\"],\n [\"EU100096\",\n\"Comprehensive Modelling for Advanced Systems of Systems\",\n\"The design of innovative products and services that take advantage of Systems of Systems (SoS) technology is in its infancy. It is hampered by the complexity caused by the heterogeneity and independence of SoS constituent systems and the difficulty of communication between diverse stakeholders. The state of the art in SoS engineering lacks models and tools that help developers to make trade-off decisions during design and evolution, and assist in working out and recording precise contracts between constituents and the global SoS. This leads to sub-optimal design and expensive rework during integration and in service.COMPASS will augment existing industry tools and practice with an underlying modelling language in which SoS architectures and contracts can be expressed. A formal semantic foundation \\u2013 the first to be developed specifically for SoS engineering \\u2013 will enable this language to support analysis of global SoS properties. The language and methods will be supported by an open, extendible tools platform with integrated prototype plug-ins for model construction, dynamic analysis by simulation and test automation, static analysis by model-checking and proof, and links to an established architectural modelling language (SysML). These strengthened foundations and tools will support enhanced methods guidelines that help users embed this new technology in industrial SoS practice.Technical advances in COMPASS are focussed on industry needs evaluated through substantial industry-led case studies in three diverse and complementary areas. These will be augmented by challenge problems solicited from a range of SoS stakeholders and developer organisations through a special interest group. The open platform, tools plug-ins, semantics, development guidelines, industry case study experience and challenge problems will ensure that COMPASS's outputs can be readily exploited by SoS developers and stakeholders as well as in future research and development.\"],\n [\"EU100097\",\n\"The Environmental Observation Web and its Service Applications within the Future Internet\",\n\"Large European communities generate significant amounts of valuable environmental observations at local and regional scales using mobile communication devices, computers and sensors which are mostly connected to the internet. These communities' environmental observations represent a wealth of information which is currently unused and therefore in need for integration with other fragmented data and information sources, traditionally managed by research and educational institutions and industries. ENVIROFI will address such important issues by specifying the requirements, and building conceptual prototypes, of the specific enablers of the environmental usage area in the Future Internet. It will bring these diverse stakeholder communities together to understand environmentally observed processes with higher spatial resolutions and contextual situation awareness at an unprecedented scale.<br/>This achievement alone could have a profound socio-economic impact in Europe and contribute towards meeting the global challenges of industrial competitiveness and smart living in this decade. ENVIROFI will explore the advances needed by the stakeholder communities for secure access to decentralized, interactive Internet-enabled geospatial and intelligent fusion services using data from authorities, researchers, people and private sector organisations. It will allow all these participants to plug in their personalised experiments and also feedback into the ENVIROFI Environmental Observation Web.<br/>ENVIROFI will consolidate the Future Internet requirements from the Environmental Usage Area perspective and provide important specifications and prototypes of interoperable geospatial Environmental Enablers. These will be deployed in the Terrestrial, Atmospheric and Marine environments in collaboration with large stakeholder communities; and set the stage for large-scale trials in the Environmental Usage Area with a perspective of achieving sustainable socio-economic progress in Europe.\"],\n [\"EU100098\",\n\"Future INternet for Smart ENergY\",\n\"The energy sector has entered a period of major change which will continue for many years to come. The increasing proportion of electricity from renewable sources means that the architecture of the energy grid will have to support the distributed, in addition to the centralised, generation of energy and to adapt to a highly volatile supply e.g. from wind and solar generators. From the consumption perspective, electric vehicles will demand new load management patterns in the grids.  At the same time, private and commercial consumers are being encouraged to reduce their energy use and electronics manufacturers are striving to reduce the energy use of their products.  The energy supply will need to evolve into a dynamic system to provide the smart energy infrastructure needed to support society in 2020 and beyond.<br/>Future Internet technologies will play a critical role in the development of Smart Energy infrastructures, enabling new functionality while reducing costs. In the FINSENY project, key actors from the ICT and energy sectors will team-up to identify the ICT requirements of Smart Energy Systems. This will lead to the definition of new solutions and standards, verified in a large scale pan-European Smart Energy trial. Project results will contribute to the emergence of a sustainable Smart Energy infrastructure, based on new products and services, to the benefit of all European citizens and the environment.<br/>As part of the FI-PPP programme, FINSENY will intensively analyse energy-specific requirements together with the other FI-PPP projects, develop solutions to address these requirements, and prepare for a Smart Energy trial in phase two of the programme. The growing FINSENY Smart Grid Stakeholder Group will provide broad visibility of the on-going project work in the energy community, enhancing the acceptability of the project results and facilitating the development of the smart energy market.\"],\n [\"EU100099\",\n\"Smart Food and Agribusiness: Future Internet for Safe and Healthy Food from Farm to Fork\",\n\"The SmartAgriFood project addresses the food and agribusiness as a use case for the Future Internet. The intelligence, efficiency, sustainability and performance of the agri-food sector can be radically enhanced by using information & decision support systems that are tightly integrated with advanced internet-based networks & services. Concurrently, the sector provides extremely demanding use cases for Future Internet design from physical layer all the way up to the service layer. This project will focus on three sub systems of the sector - smart farming, focussing on sensors and traceability; smart agri-logistics, focusing on real-time virtualisation, connectivity and logistics intelligence; and smart food awareness,  focussing on transparency of data and knowledge representation. Using a user-centred methodology, the use case specification will be developed with a particular focus on transparency and interoperability of data and knowledge across the food supply chain. Project results will include:-Use Case descriptions for smart farming, including sophisticated and robust broadband sensing and monitoring of animals and plants-Use Case descriptions for smart agri-logistics, including intelligent transport and real-time logistics of agri-food products-Use Case descriptions of smart food awareness, focussing enabling the consumer with information concerning safety, health, environmental impact and animal welfare-Identification of generic requirements for the generic enablers-Extensive community and user organisation involvement both in requirements gathering, pilot demonstration, and evaluation-Specification of interfaces and functionalities for integration to Core Platform,-Significant contributions to standardisation and regulatory bodies in Europe.Key features of SmartAgriFood concepts will be demonstrated and verified by simulations and experimental systems within this project and by large scale demonstration as intended in Phase II.\"],\n [\"EU100100\",\n\"Instant Mobility for Passengers and Goods\",\n\"The Instant Mobility project has created a concept for a virtual 'Transport and Mobility Internet', a platform for information and services able to support radically new types of connected applications for scenarios centred on the stakeholder groups:\\u0095\\\\tmultimodal travellers\\u0095\\\\tdrivers & passengers\\u0095\\\\tpassenger transport operators\\u0095\\\\tgoods vehicle operators\\u0095\\\\troad operators & traffic managers.The project will define requirements for Future Internet technology tools and enablers, so that all these services will be available to any Internet-connected user, whether using a portable, vehicle-based or fixed terminal.These requirements will underpin a set of technical specifications for both domain-specific and FI enablers that will in turn be created as software conceptual prototypes for a virtual demonstration.The project will prepare a plan for implementing in Phase 2 some limited-scale trials in a number of real cities, using a Transport and Mobility Internet platform as subset of the full FI PPP core platform.Instant Mobility will also study the non-technical framework conditions that may support or hinder eventual deployment of FI-enabled online services in the T&M domain.The project will put forward its research results for support to standardisation, either for FI standards for standards in the T&M domain.\"],\n [\"EU100101\",\n\"Provisioning of urban/regional smart services and business models enabled by the Future Internet\",\n\"The goal of OUTSMART is to contribute to the Future Internet (FI) by aiming at the development of five innovation eco-systems. These eco-systems facilitate the creation of a large variety of pilot services and technologies that contribute to optimised supply and access to services and resources in urban areas. This will contribute to more sustainable utility provision and, through increased efficiency, lower strain on resources and on the environment. Reaching this goal requires the whole value chain, namely city authorities, utilities operators, ICT companies as well as knowledge institutions in order to have an industry driven approach when developing advanced services and technologies. OUTSMART services and technologies will be based on an open and standardised infrastructure as envisioned by the FI Private Public Partnership (FI PPP) and provided by a service framework designed to facilitate provisioning, development and access.To this extend, OUTSMART will (1) deliver a set of detailed functional and non-functional requirements for an FI enabler platform and corresponding business framework able to support the above described eco-systems; (2) provide a specification of the domain specific enabler functionality with corresponding service interfaces compatible and aligned with Core Platform components to be specified alongside this project effort; (3) provide a realisation of prototypes of domain specific functionality for the envisioned eco-system and a validation thereof in early field trials in the envisioned use cases; (4) deliver a business framework specification which serves as blue print for the foreseen local eco-systems able to provide their sustainability beyond the PPP funding lifetime by creating favourable conditions for local investment and innovation; and (5) deliver a detailed plan for pilot services in the envisioned local eco-systems, which act as initial light house show cases for Europe in the utility and environment applications domain.\"]],\n        columns: [[\"string\", \"ID\"], [\"string\", \"TITLE\"], [\"string\", \"DESCRIPTION\"]],\n        columnOptions: [],\n        rowsPerPage: 5,\n        helpUrl: \"https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/data_table.ipynb\",\n        suppressOutputScrolling: true,\n        minimumWidth: undefined,\n      });\n    ",
